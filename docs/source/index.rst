Thank you for choosing the SunFounder Kepler Kit

This is an learning kit based on the Raspberry Pi Pico W. 

Raspberry Pi Pico W adds on-board single-band 2.4GHz wireless interfaces (802.11n) using the Infineon CYW4343 while retaining the Pico form factor, so in addition to the basic GPIO function, it can also connect to the network so we can use it for some IoT projects.
For example, using IFTTT for a security system, building a cloud player and a cloud service bell system using MQTT and so on.

This kit contains a variety of components, including displays, sounds, drivers, controllers and sensors, which allows you to gain a comprehensive understanding of electronic devices.

Additionally, we offer three programming languages. MicroPython, C/C++ (Arduino) and Piper Make are all available. To help you get started quickly, each language has targeted and interesting projects, so you can pick one that meets your needs.

Please feel free to e-mail us if you are interested in learning other projects we don't have. We will update our online tutorials as soon as possible.

Here is the email: service@sunfounder.com.
