Photoresistor
==============

|img_photoresistor|

A photoresistor or photocell is a light-controlled variable resistor. 
The resistance of a photoresistor decreases with increasing incident light intensity; in other words, it exhibitsÂ photo conductivity. 

A photoresistor can be applied in light-sensitive detector circuits and light-activated and dark-activated switching circuits acting as a resistance semiconductor. In the dark, a photoresistor can have a resistance as high as several megaohms (MÎ©), while in the light, a photoresistor can have a resistance as low as a few hundred ohms.

Here is the electronic symbol of photoresistor.
