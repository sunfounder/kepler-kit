Infrared Receiver
=================================

IR Receiver
----------------------------

|img_irrecv|

* S: Signal output
* +: VCC
* -: GND

An infrared-receiver is a component which receives infrared signals and can independently receive infrared rays and output signals compatible with TTL level. It is similar with a normal plastic-packaged transistor in size and is suitable for all kinds of infrared remote control and infrared transmission.

Infrared, or IR, communication is a popular, low-cost, easy-to-use wireless communication technology. Infrared light has a slightly longer wavelength than visible light, so it is imperceptible to the human eye - ideal for wireless communication. A common modulation scheme for infrared communication is 38KHz modulation.

* Adopted HX1838 IR Receiver Sensor, high sensitivity
* Can be used for remote control
* Power Supply: 3.3~5V
* Interface: Digital
* Modulate Frequency: 38Khz


Remote Control
-------------------------

|img_controller|

This is a Mini thin infrared wireless remote control with 21 function buttons and a transmitting distance of up to 8 meters, which is suitable for operating a wide range of devices in a kid's room.

* Size: 85x39x6mm
* Remote control range: 8-10m
* Battery: 3V button type lithium manganese battery
* Infrared carrier frequency: 38KHz
* Surface paste material: 0.125mm PET
* Effective life: more than 20,000 times
