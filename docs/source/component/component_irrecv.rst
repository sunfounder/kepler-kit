Infrared Receiver
=================================

IR Receiver
----------------------------

* S: Signal output
* +: VCC
* -: GND

An infrared-receiver is a component which receives infrared signals and can independently receive infrared rays and output signals compatible with TTL level. It is similar with a normal plastic-packaged transistor in size and is suitable for all kinds of infrared remote control and infrared transmission.

Infrared, or IR, communication is a popular, low-cost, easy-to-use wireless communication technology. Infrared light has a slightly longer wavelength than visible light, so it is imperceptible to the human eye - ideal for wireless communication. A common modulation scheme for infrared communication is 38KHz modulation.

* Adopted HX1838 IR Receiver Sensor, high sensitivity
* Can be used for remote control
* Power Supply: 3.3~5V
* Interface: Digital
* Modulate Frequency: 38Khz


Remote Control
-------------------------
