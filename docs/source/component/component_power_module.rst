Power Supply Module
===================

A 3.3V and 5V breadboard power module with series diode and reverse polarity protection.
The module can accept 6.5V to 12V input, and can generate 3.3V and +5V.
For experimenters who must test/prototype electronic circuits on breadboards or perforated/veroboards, this is a must-have power supply module.
