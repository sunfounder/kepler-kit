Micro Switch
========================

|img_micro_switch|

The construction of a micro switch is really simple. The main parts of the switch are:

|img_micro_switch2|

* 1.Plunger (Actuator)
* 2.Cover
* 3.Moving piece
* 4.Support
* 5.Case
* 6.NO terminal: normally open
* 7.NC terminal: normally closed
* 8.Contact
* 9.Moving arm


After a micro switch makes physical contact with an object, its contacts change position. The basic working principle is as follows.

When the plunger is in the released or rest position.

* The normally closed circuit can carry current.
* The normally open circuit is electrically insulated.

When the plunger is depressed or switched.

* The normally closed circuit is open.
* The normally open circuit is closed.
