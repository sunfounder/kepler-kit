Centrifugal Pump
================

|img_pump|

The centrifugal pump converts rotational kinetic energy into hydrodynamic energy to transport fluid. The rotation energy comes from the electric motor. The fluid enters the pump impeller along or near the rotating shaft, is accelerated by the impeller, flows radially outward into the diffuser or volute chamber, and then flows out from there.

Common uses of centrifugal pumps include water, sewage, agricultural, petroleum, and petrochemical pumping.

    * It is a submersible pump and should be used that way. It tends to heat too much that there's a risk of overheating if you turn it on unsubmerged.
