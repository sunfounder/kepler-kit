6.4 - IR Remote Control
================================

In consumer electronics, remote controls are used to operate devices such as televisions and DVD players.
In some cases, remote controls allow people to operate devices that are out of their reach, such as central air conditioners.

IR Receiver is a component with photocell that is tuned to receive to infrared light. 
It is almost always used for remote control detection - every TV and DVD player has one of these in the front to receive for the IR signal from the clicker. 
Inside the remote control is a matching IR LED, which emits IR pulses to tell the TV to turn on, off or change channels.

The new remote control has a plastic piece at the end to isolate the battery inside. You need to pull out this plastic piece to power up the remote when you are using it.
Once the program is running, when you press the remote control, the Serial Monitor will print out the key you pressed.


**How it works?**

This code is designed to work with an infrared (IR) remote control using the ``IRremote`` library. Here's the breakdown:

#. Including the library and defining constants. First, the IRremote library is included, and the pin number for the IR receiver is defined as 2.

   .. code-block:: cpp
 
     #include <IRremote.h>
     const int IR_RECEIVE_PIN = 17;


#. Initializes serial communication at a baud rate of 9600. Initializes the IR receiver on the specified pin (``IR_RECEIVE_PIN``) and enables LED feedback (if applicable).

   .. code-block:: arduino

       void setup() {
           Serial.begin(9600);                                     // Start serial communication at 9600 baud rate
           IrReceiver.begin(IR_RECEIVE_PIN, ENABLE_LED_FEEDBACK);  // Start the IR receiver
       }

#. The loop runs continuously to process incoming IR remote signals.

   .. code-block:: arduino

      void loop() {
         if (IrReceiver.decode()) {  // Check if the IR receiver has received a signal
            bool result = 0;
            String key = decodeKeyValue(IrReceiver.decodedIRData.command);
            if (key != "ERROR") {
              Serial.println(key);  // Print the readable command
              delay(100);
            }
         IrReceiver.resume();  // Prepare the IR receiver to receive the next signal
        }
      }
   
   * Checks if an IR signal is received and successfully decoded.
   * Decodes the IR command and stores it in ``decodedValue`` using a custom ``decodeKeyValue()`` function.
   * Prints the decoded IR value to the serial monitor.
   * Resumes IR signal reception for the next signal.
