1.1 Install Arduino IDE(Important)
======================================

The Arduino IDE, known as Arduino Integrated Development Environment, provides all the software support needed to complete an Arduino project. It is a programming software specifically designed for Arduino, provided by the Arduino team, that allows us to write programs and upload them to the Arduino board. 

The Arduino IDE 2.0 is an open-source project. It is a big step from its sturdy predecessor, Arduino IDE 1.x, and comes with revamped UI, improved board & library manager, debugger, autocomplete feature and much more.

In this tutorial, we will show how to download and install the Arduino IDE 2.0 on your Windows, Mac, or Linux computer.

Requirements
-------------------

* Windows - Win 10 and newer, 64 bits
* Linux - 64 bits
