2.6 - Tilt ItÔºÅ
==========================

|img_tilt|

The tilt switch is a 2-pin device with a metal ball in the middle. When you put it upright, the 2 pins are connected together; when you tilt the switch, 2 pins will be disconnected.


**Required Components**

In this project, we need the following components. 

It's definitely convenient to buy a whole kit, here's the link:

**Schematic**

|sch_tilt|

When you put it upright, GP14 will get high; after tilting it, GP14 will get low.

The purpose of the 10K resistor is to keep the GP14 in a stable low state when the tilt switch is in a tilted state.

.. note::

    * You can open the file ``2.6_tilt_it.ino`` under the path of ``kepler-kit-main/arduino/2.4_colorful_light``. 
    * Or copy this code into **Arduino IDE**.
    * Don't forget to select the board(Raspberry Pi Pico) and the correct port before clicking the **Upload** button.

After the program runs, when you tilt the breadboard (tilt switch), "The switch works!" will appear in the shell.
