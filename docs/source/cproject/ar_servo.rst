3.7 - Swinging Servo
=======================

In this kit, in addition to LED and passive buzzer, there is also a device controlled by PWM signal, Servo.

Servo is a position (angle) servo device, which is suitable for those control systems that require constant angle changes and can be maintained. It has been widely used in high-end remote control toys, such as airplanes, submarine models, and remote control robots.

Now, try to make the servo sway!

When the program is running, we can see the Servo Arm swinging back and forth from 0° to 180°. 


**How it works?**

By calling the library ``Servo.h``, you can drive the servo easily. 

.. code-block:: arduino

    #include <Servo.h> 

**Library Functions**

.. code-block:: arduino

    Servo

Create **Servo** object to control a servo.

.. code-block:: arduino

    uint8_t attach(int pin); 

Turn a pin into a servo driver. Calls pinMode. Returns 0 on failure.

.. code-block:: arduino

    void detach();

Release a pin from servo driving.

.. code-block:: arduino

    void write(int value); 

Set the angle of the servo in degrees, 0 to 180.

.. code-block:: arduino

    int read();

Return that value set with the last write().

.. code-block:: arduino

    bool attached(); 

Return 1 if the servo is currently attached.
