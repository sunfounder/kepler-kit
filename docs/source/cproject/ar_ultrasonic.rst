6.1 - Measuring Distance
======================================

The ultrasonic sensor module works on the principle of sonar and radar systems for determining the distance to an object.

* :ref:`cpn_ultrasonic`

Once the program is running, the Serial Monitor will print out the distance of the ultrasonic sensor from the obstacle ahead.


**How it works?**

About the application of ultrasonic sensor, we can directly check the
subfunction.

.. code-block:: arduino

    float readSensorData(){// ...}

``PING`` is triggered by a HIGH pulse of 2 or more microseconds. (Give a
short ``LOW`` pulse beforehand to ensure a clean ``HIGH`` pulse.)

.. code-block:: arduino

    digitalWrite(trigPin, LOW); 
    delayMicroseconds(2);
    digitalWrite(trigPin, HIGH); 
    delayMicroseconds(10);
    digitalWrite(trigPin, LOW); 

The echo pin is used to read signal from PING, a ``HIGH`` pulse whose
duration is the time (in microseconds) from the sending of the ping to
the reception of echo of the object.

.. code-block:: arduino

    microsecond=pulseIn(echoPin, HIGH);

The speed of sound is 340 m/s or 29 microseconds per centimeter.

This gives the distance travelled by the ping, outbound and return, so
we divide by 2 to get the distance of the obstacle.

.. code-block:: arduino

    float distance = microsecond / 29.00 / 2;  


Note that the ultrasonic sensor will pause the program when it is working, which may cause some lagging when writing complex projects.
