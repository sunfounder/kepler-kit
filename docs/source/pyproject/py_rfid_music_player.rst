7.8 RFID Music Player
==========================

Through our previous project, :ref:`py_rfid`, we learned that the MFRC522 module allows us to write up to 48 letters of information to the card (or key), including both the key and identity information, as well as the music score.

As an example, if you write ``EEFGGFEDCCDEEDD EEFGGFEDCCDEDCC``, the buzzer will play the music when the card (or key) is read again. It can also be equipped with an WS2812 to display amazing effects.

You can find more sheet music on the Internet, or even write your own music, put them into the card (or key), and share them with your friends!

**Wiring**

|wiring_rfid_music_player| 

**Code**

#. Open the ``6.5_rfid_write.py`` file under the path of ``kepler-kit-main/micropython``, then click "Run Current Script" or simply press F5 to run it.

   .. note::

    Here you need to use the libraries in ``mfrc522`` folder, please check if it has been uploaded to Pico, for a detailed tutorial refer to :ref:`add_libraries_py`.

#. After running, type ``EEFGGFEDCCDEEDD EEFGGFEDCCDEDCC`` in the shell, then bring the card (or key) close to the MFRC522 module to store a score of "Ode to Joy".

#. Open the ``7.8_rfid_music_player.py`` file under the path of ``kepler-kit-main/micropython`` or copy this code into Thonny, then click "Run Current Script" or simply press F5 to run it.
