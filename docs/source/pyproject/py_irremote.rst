6.4 IR Remote Control
================================

In consumer electronics, remote controls are used to operate devices such as televisions and DVD players.
In some cases, remote controls allow people to operate devices that are out of their reach, such as central air conditioners.

IR Receiver is a component with photocell that is tuned to receive to infrared light. 
It is almost always used for remote control detection - every TV and DVD player has one of these in the front to receive for the IR signal from the clicker. 
Inside the remote control is a matching IR LED, which emits IR pulses to tell the TV to turn on, off or change channels.

The new remote control has a plastic piece at the end to isolate the battery inside. You need to pull out this plastic piece to power up the remote when you are using it.
Once the program is running, when you press the remote control, the Shell will print out the key you pressed.

**How it works?**

This program looks slightly complicated, but it actually does the basic functions of the IR receiver with just a few lines.

.. code-block:: python

    import time
    from machine import Pin, freq
    from ir_rx.nec import NEC_8

    pin_ir = Pin(17, Pin.IN)

    # User callback
    def callback(data, addr, ctrl):
        if data < 0:  # NEC protocol sends repeat codes.
            pass
        else:
            print(decodeKeyValue(data))

    ir = NEC_8(pin_ir, callback)  # Instantiate receiver

Here an ``ir`` object is instantiated, which reads the signals acquired by the IR receiver at any time.

The result will be recorded in ``data`` of the callback function.

* `Callback Function - Wikipedia <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Callback_(computer_programming)>`_

If the IR receiver receives duplicate values (e.g. pressing a key and not releasing it), then data < 0 and this data needs to be filtered.

Otherwise data would be a usable value, but some unspeakable code, and the ``decodeKeyValue(data)`` function is used to decode it.

.. code-block:: python

    def decodeKeyValue(data):
        if data == 0x16:
            return "0"
        if data == 0x0C:
            return "1"
        if data == 0x18:
            return "2"
        if data == 0x5E:
            return "3"
        if data == 0x08:
            return "4"
        if data == 0x1C:
            return "5"
        if data == 0x5A:
            return "6"
        if data == 0x42:
            return "7"
        if data == 0x52:
            return "8"
        if data == 0x4A:
            return "9"
        if data == 0x09:
            return "+"
        if data == 0x15:
            return "-"
        if data == 0x7:
            return "EQ"
        if data == 0x0D:
            return "U/SD"
        if data == 0x19:
            return "CYCLE"
        if data == 0x44:
            return "PLAY/PAUSE"
        if data == 0x43:
            return "FORWARD"
        if data == 0x40:
            return "BACKWARD"
        if data == 0x45:
            return "POWER"
        if data == 0x47:
            return "MUTE"
        if data == 0x46:
            return "MODE" 
        return "ERROR"

If we press key **1**, the IR receiver outputs a value like ``0x0C``, which needs to be decoded to correspond to the specific key.

Next are some debug functions. They are important, but not related to the effect we need to achieve, so we just put them in the program.

.. code-block:: python

    from ir_rx.print_error import print_error

    ir.error_function(print_error) # Show debug information

Finally, we use an empty loop as the main program. And use try-except to make the program exit with the ``ir`` object terminated.

.. code-block:: python

    try:
        while True:
            pass
    except KeyboardInterrupt:
        ir.close()
