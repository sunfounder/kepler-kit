7.12 Digital Bubble Level
============================


A `bubble Level <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spirit_level>`_, is an instrument designed to indicate whether a surface is horizontal (level) or vertical (plumb). There are different types of spirit levels used by carpenters, stonemasons, bricklayers, other building trades workers, surveyors, millwrights, and other metalworkers, as well as in some photographic and videographic work.

Here we make a digital bubble level using MPU6050 and 8x8 LED matrix. When you deflect the MPU6050, the bubble on the LED matrix will also be deflected.


**Required Components**

In this project, we need the following components.

**Schematic**

|sch_bubble_level|

The MPU6050 takes the acceleration values in each direction and calculates the attitude angle.

As a result, the program draws a 2x2 dot on the dot matrix based on data from the two 74HC595 chips.

As the attitude angle changes, the program sends different data to the 74HC595 chips, and the position of the dot changes, creating a bubble effect.

Once you have run the program, place the breadboard on a level surface.
A dot will appear in the center of the LED matrix (if it isn't in the center, the MPU6050 may not be level).
When you deflect the breadboard, the dot will move in the direction you deflected.
