7.9 Fruit Piano
============================


Electrical conductivity is found in many metal objects, as well as in the human body and fruits.
This property can be used to create a fun little project: a fruit piano.
In other words, we turn fruits into keyboards that can play music just by touching them.

**Schematic**

|sch_fruit_piano| 

To turn the fruit into a piano key, you still need to connect the electrodes on the MPR121 to the fruit (e.g. into the banana handle).

In the beginning, MPR121 will initialize and each electrode will get a value based on the current charge; when a conductor (such as a human body) touches an electrode, the charge will shift and rebalance.
As a result, the electrode's value is different from its initial value, telling the main control board that it has been touched.
During this process, ensure that the wiring of each electrode is stable so that its charge is balanced when initializing.

.. note::

    * Open the ``7.9_fruit_piano.py`` file under the path of ``kepler-kit-main/micropython`` or copy this code into Thonny, then click "Run Current Script" or simply press F5 to run it.

    * Don't forget to click on the "MicroPython (Raspberry Pi Pico)" interpreter in the bottom right corner. 

    * For detailed tutorials, please refer to :ref:`open_run_code_py`. 
    
    * Here you need to use the library called ``mpr121.py``, please check if it has been uploaded to Pico W, for a detailed tutorial refer to :ref:`add_libraries_py`.

Please do not touch the fruit before the program runs to avoid getting a non-correct reference during initialization.
After the program runs, touch the fruit gently, the buzzer will sound the corresponding tone and the RGB light will flash once randomly.
