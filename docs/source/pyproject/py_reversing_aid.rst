7.10 Reversing Aid
======================

This project uses an LED, a buzzer and an ultrasonic module to create a reversing assist system.
We can put it on a remote control car to simulate the the actual process of reversing a car into a garage.


**Required Components**

In this project, we need the following components. 

It's definitely convenient to buy a whole kit, here's the link:

* As soon as the program runs, the ultrasonic sensor will continuously read the distance to the obstacle in front of you, and you will be able to see the exact distance value on the shell.
* The LED and buzzer will change the frequency of blinking and beeping depending on the distance value, thus indicating the approach of the obstacle.
* The :ref:`py_ultrasonic` article mentioned that when the ultrasonic sensor works, the program will be paused.
* To avoid interfering with the LED or buzzer timing, we created a separate thread for ranging in this example.
