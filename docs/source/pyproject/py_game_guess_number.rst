7.7 Guess Number
==============================


Guessing Numbers is a fun party game where you and your friends input numbers (0-99). With each input of the number, the range will shrink until a player answers the riddle correctly. Then the player is defeated and punished. 

As an example, if the lucky number is 51, which the players cannot see, and the player 1 inputs 50, the prompt changes to 50 - 99; if the player 2 inputs 70, the range changes to 50 - 70; if the player 3 inputs 51, the player is unlucky. In this case, numbers are inputted through the keypad, and outcomes are displayed on a LCD screen.

**Schematic**


|sch_guess_number|

This circuit is based on :ref:`py_keypad` with the addition of an I2C LCD1602 to display the pressed keys.


**Wiring**

|wiring_game_guess_number| 

To make the wiring easier, in the above diagram, the column row of the matrix keyboard and the 10K resistors are inserted into the holes where G10 ~ G13 are located at the same time.


**Code**

.. note::

    * Open the ``7.7_game_guess_number.py`` file under the path of ``kepler-kit-main/micropython`` or copy this code into Thonny, then click "Run Current Script" or simply press F5 to run it.

    * Don't forget to click on the "MicroPython (Raspberry Pi Pico)" interpreter in the bottom right corner. 

    * For detailed tutorials, please refer to :ref:`open_run_code_py`.

* After the code runs, press ``A`` to start the game. A random number ``point`` is produced but not displayed on the LCD, and what you need to do is to guess it. 
* The number you have typed appears at the end of the first line till the final calculation is finished. (Press ``D`` to start the comparation.)
* The number range of ``point`` is displayed on the second line. And you must type the number within the range. 
* When you type a number, the range narrows; if you got the lucky number luckily or unluckily, there will appear ``GAME OVER!``.

.. note:: 
    If the code and wiring are fine, but the LCD still does not display content, you can turn the potentiometer on the back to increase the contrast.
