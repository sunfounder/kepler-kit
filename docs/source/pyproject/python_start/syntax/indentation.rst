Indentation
=============

Indentation refers to the spaces at the beginning of a code line.
Like standard Python programs, MicroPython programs usually run from top to bottom:
It traverses each line in turn, runs it in the interpreter, and then continues to the next line,
Just like you type them line by line in the Shell.
A program that just browses the instruction list line by line is not very smart, though â€“ so MicroPython, just like Python, has its own method to control the sequence of its program execution: indentation.

You must put at least one space before print(), otherwise an error message "Invalid syntax" will appear. It is usually recommended to standardise spaces by pressing the Tab key uniformly.



.. code-block:: python

    if 8 > 5:
    print("Eight is greater than Five!")

>>> %Run -c $EDITOR_CONTENT
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 2
SyntaxError: invalid syntax

You must use the same number of spaces in the same block of code, or Python will give you an error.


.. code-block:: python

    if 8 > 5:
    print("Eight is greater than Five!")
            print("Eight is greater than Five")
            
>>> %Run -c $EDITOR_CONTENT
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 2
SyntaxError: invalid syntax
