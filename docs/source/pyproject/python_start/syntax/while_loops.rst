While Loops
====================

The ``while`` statement is used to execute a program in a loop, that is, to execute a program in a loop under certain conditions to handle the same task that needs to be processed repeatedly. 

Its basic form is:

.. code-block:: python

    while test expression:
        Body of while


In the ``while`` loop, first check the ``test expression``. Only when ``test expression`` evaluates to ``True``, enter the body of the while. After one iteration, check the ``test expression`` again. This process continues until ``test expression`` evaluates to ``False``.

In MicroPython, the body of the ``while`` loop is determined by indentation.

The body starts with an indentation and ends with the first unindented line.

Python interprets any non-zero value as ``True``. None and 0 are interpreted as ``False``.

        print(x)
        x -= 1

Break Statement
--------------------

With the break statement we can stop the loop even if the while condition is true:



.. code-block:: python

    x = 10

    while x > 0:
        print(x)
        if x == 6:
            break
        x -= 1

>>> %Run -c $EDITOR_CONTENT
10

While Loop with Else
----------------------
Like the ``if`` loop, the ``while`` loop can also have an optional ``else`` block.

If the condition in the ``while`` loop is evaluated as ``False``, the ``else`` part is executed.



.. code-block:: python

    x = 10

    while x > 0:
        print(x)
        x -= 1
    else:
        print("Game Over")

>>> %Run -c $EDITOR_CONTENT
