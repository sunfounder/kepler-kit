7.5 GAME - 10 Second
=======================


To challenge your concentration, follow me next to make a game device. 
Make a magic wand by connecting the tilt switch with a stick. When you shake the wand, the 4-digit segment display will start counting, and when you shake it again, it will stop counting. In order to win, you must keep the displayed count at **10.00**. You can play the game with your friends to see who is the time wizard.

**Required Components**

In this project, we need the following components. 

It's definitely convenient to buy a whole kit, here's the link:

**Schematic**


|sch_10_second|


* This circuit is based on :ref:`py_74hc_4dig` with the addition of a tilt switch.
* GP16 is high when the tilt switch is upright; low when tilted.

        display(count)  # Update the display with the current count


The 4-digit 7-segment display will begin counting when you shake the wand, and will stop counting when you shake it again. 
You win if you manage to keep the displayed count at 10.00. The game will continue after one more shake.
