7.6 Traffic Light
=================================


`Traffic Light <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traffic_light>`_ is a signal device located at roadway intersections, crosswalks and other locations to control the flow of traffic.

Traffic signals are standardized by the `Vienna Convention on Road Signs and Signals <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vienna_Convention_on_Road_Signs_and_Signals>`_.
Provides users with the right-of-way by alternating LEDs in three standard colors.

* **Red light**: Traffic should stop if it sees a flashing red light, equivalent to a stop sign.
* **Yellow light**: A warning signal is about to turn red. Yellow lights are interpreted differently in different countries (regions).
* **Green light**: Allows traffic to move in the indicated direction.

In this project, we will use three colors of LEDs to implement traffic light changes and a 4-digit 7-segment display to show the time of each traffic state.

**Required Components**

In this project, we need the following components. 

It's definitely convenient to buy a whole kit, here's the link:

**Schematic**


|sch_traffic_light|


* This circuit is based on the :ref:`py_74hc_4dig` with the addition of 3 LEDs.
* The 3 red, yellow and green LEDs are connected to GP7~GP9 respectively.

**Wiring**

When the code runs, the green LED stays on for 30 seconds, the yellow LED stays on for 5 seconds, and the green LED stays on for 30 seconds.
