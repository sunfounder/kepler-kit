2.7 Swing Servo
=====================

In this project, we use a servo and a potentiometer to simulate a steering wheel. Rotating the potentiometer will drive the servo to turn together.

* :ref:`cpn_servo`


**Wiring**

|controllable_servo0|


* The orange wire (signal) of the servo is connected to GP15, the red wire (power) is connected to VBUS, and the brown wire (ground) is connected to GND. 
* Potentiometer is a resistive element with 3 terminals, the 2 side pins are connected to 5V and GND, and the middle pin is connected to GP26(A0).

**Code**

.. note::

    * You can refer to the image below to write code by dragging and dropping. 
    * Import ``2.7_swing_servo.png`` from the path of ``kepler-kit-main\piper``. For detailed tutorials, please refer to :ref:`import_code_piper`.

|controllable_servo|

* After connecting Pico W, click the **Start** button and the code starts to run.
* Turn the potentiometer and the servo will follow. To see it clearly, you can insert a rocker arm in the servo shaft.

**How it Works?**

|controllable_servo1|

Set the rotation speed of pin15 (servo) to 15%.

* [servo pin() set speed to ()%]：Used to set the rotation speed of the servo pin, the range is 0%~100%.

|controllable_servo2|

Create a variable [angle], then read the voltage of A0. Use the [map value () from () to ()] block, map the voltage of A0 from 0 to 3.3V voltage range to 0 to 180°, and then use the mapped angle as the rotation angle of the servo.

* [map value () from () to ()]: map a value from one range to another.

.. note::
    The voltage of A0~A2 takes the range of 0~3.3V, even if your power supply is connected to VBUS (5V).
