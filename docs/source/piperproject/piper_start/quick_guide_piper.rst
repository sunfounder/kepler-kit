1.2 Quick Guide on Piper Make
=================================

1. Create New Project
-----------------------

Now that you have set up Pico W, it is time to learn how to program it. 
Now let's light up the onboard LED.


Switch to ``CREATIVE MODE`` and click on the **New Project** button, 
and a new project will appear in the **MY PROJECTS** section and 
will be assigned a random name that can be changed from the programming page.

Then open the new project just created.

|media11-s|

Now go to the Piper Make programming page.

* **START**: Used to run the code, if it's gray, it's not connected to Pico W at this time.
* **Block palette**: contains different types of blocks.
* **CONNECT**: Used to connect to Pico W, it is green when not connected to Pico W, when connected it will become **DISCONNECT(red)**.
* **Programming Area**: Drag blocks here to finish programming by stacking them.
* **Tools Area**: You can click **DIGITAL VIEW** to see the pin distribution of Pico W; you can view the print information in **CONSOLE**; you can read data from **DATA**, and you can click **Python** to view the Python source code.
* **Project name and description**: You can change the project name and description.
* **DOWNLOAD**: You can click the **DOWNLOAD** button to save it locally, usually in **|** format. Next time you can import it via the **Import Project** button on the home page.

Click on the **Chip** palette and drag the [start] block to the **Programming Area**.

Then drag the [loop] block in **loops** palette to the bottom of the [start] block, and set the loop interval to 1 second.

The Raspberry Pi Pico's onboard LED is at pin25, so we use the [turn pin () ON/OFF] block on the **Chip** palette to control it.

2. Connect to Pico W
-----------------------

Now click on the **CONNECT** button to connect to Pico W, after clicking on it a new popup will appear.

|media16|

Select the recognized **CircuitPython CDC control (COMXX)** port, then click on **Connect**. 

|pico_port|

When the connection is successful, the green **CONNECT** in the bottom left corner will change to a red **DISCONNECT**.

3. Run the Code
------------------

Now click on the **START** button to run this code and you will see the LED on the Pico W lit up. If yours is gray, it means that the Pico W is not connected, please reconnect it.

Then turn off pin25 every second in the cycle, and click **START** on the upper left again, so that you can see the onboard LED lights flashing.
