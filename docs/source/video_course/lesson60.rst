Lesson 60: Control NeoPixel Colors with a Joystick in MicroPython
=============================================================================

This tutorial covers controlling an LED strip with a joystick using the Raspberry Pi Pico W:

* **Wiring Setup**:

    - Connect joystick ground to pin 38, 3.3V to pin 36, VRX to GPIO pin 27, VRY to GPIO pin 26. 
    - Connect Neopixel ground to pin 38, 5V to pin 40, data to GPIO pin 0.
    
* **Code Implementation**: 

    - Import libraries (``machine``, ``time``, ``math``, ``neopixel``). 
    - Set up ADC for joystick and Neopixel. Read joystick values, calculate angles. 
    - Convert angles to RGB for Neopixel.

* **Homework Assignment**: Write a program to control Neopixel color and brightness based on joystick angle and distance from center.
