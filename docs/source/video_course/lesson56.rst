lesson 56 : Using a Joystick With MicroPython
=============================================================================

This tutorial covers using a joystick with the Raspberry Pi Pico W:

* **Wiring Setup**:
   - Connect ground, 3.3V, VRX to GPIO pin 27, and VRY to GPIO pin 26.
* **Code Implementation**:
   - Import necessary libraries (`machine`, `time`, `math`).
   - Set up ADC for joystick axes.
   - Read and print joystick values to understand range and behavior.
* **Calibration**:
   - Adjust readings to be more intuitive, converting them to a scale from -100 to +100 for easier interpretation.
* **Homework Assignment**:
   - Write a program to calibrate the joystick so that the center position reads (0,0), and edges read Â±100.
