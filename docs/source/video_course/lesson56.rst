Lesson 56: Using a Joystick With MicroPython
=============================================================================

This tutorial covers using a joystick with the Raspberry Pi Pico W:

* **Wiring Setup**: Connect ground, 3.3V, VRX to GPIO pin 27, and VRY to GPIO pin 26.
* **Code Implementation**: Import ``machine``, ``time``, ``math``; set up ADC for joystick axes; read and print joystick values.
* **Calibration**: Convert readings to a -100 to +100 scale for intuitive interpretation.
* **Homework Assignment**: Write a program to calibrate the joystick so the center reads (0,0) and edges read Â±100.
