Lesson 65:  Create a Servo Class and Method in MicroPython
===================================================================================

This tutorial covers creating a Servo class using object-oriented programming (OOP) with the Raspberry Pi Pico W:

* **Concept Overview**: Control a servo using a custom ``Servo`` class.
* **Example Implementation**: Connect the servo to the Raspberry Pi Pico W, define the ``Servo`` class with ``__init__`` and ``pos`` methods to control position, and instantiate a servo object to move it.
* **Homework Assignment**: Create a ``Servo`` class to set angles and control movement based on user input. Review Lesson 36 for servo details.
* **Key Takeaways**: Learn to implement classes for hardware control, use methods to manage servo position.
