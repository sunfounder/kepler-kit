lesson 65 :  Create a Servo Class and Method in MicroPython
===================================================================================

This tutorial covers creating a Servo class using object-oriented programming (OOP) with the Raspberry Pi Pico W:

* **Wiring Setup**:
Connect the red wire of the servo to physical pin 40 (3.3V), the brown wire to pin 38 (ground), and the orange control wire to GPIO pin 17.
* **Class and Methods**:
 - Define a `Servo` class to manage servo objects.
 - Initialize the servo with the `__init__` method, setting up the PWM pin.
 - Implement a `pos` method to control the servo's position.
* **Code Implementation**:
 - Import necessary libraries (`machine` and `time`).
 - Create the `Servo` class with the `__init__` and `pos` methods.
 - Instantiate a servo object and control its position using the `pos` method.
* **Homework Assignment**:
 - Review lesson 36 for details on working with servos. Create a Servo class that allows easy control of the servo's position by setting angles. Implement a method to move the servo based on user input.
