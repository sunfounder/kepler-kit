lesson 41 : Inferring Tilt From a 3 Axis Accelerometer
=============================================================================
This tutorial covers measuring acceleration in three axes using the MPU6050 sensor with the Raspberry Pi Pico W:

* **Introduction**:
 - Measuring acceleration in X, Y, and Z axes.
 - Understanding the Z-axis acceleration due to gravity.
* **Review of Previous Lesson**:
 - Recap of measuring X and Y axes acceleration.
 - Homework assignment: measure and predict Z-axis behavior.
* **Z-Axis Acceleration**:
 - Explanation of 1G acceleration in the Z-axis when stationary due to gravity.
 - Demonstration of tilting the sensor affecting X, Y, and Z readings.
* **Practical Application**:
 - Using the sensor to measure tilt (pitch and roll) for applications in carpentry, off-roading, and aviation.
* **Homework Assignment**:
 - Calculate tilt angles (pitch and roll) using sensor data.
 - Apply mathematical concepts from previous lessons.
