lesson 41 : Inferring Tilt From a 3 Axis Accelerometer
=============================================================================
This tutorial covers measuring acceleration in three axes using the MPU6050 sensor with the Raspberry Pi Pico W:

* **Introduction**: Measuring acceleration in X, Y, and Z axes, focusing on Z-axis due to gravity.
* **Review of Previous Lesson**: Recap of X and Y axes acceleration and homework on Z-axis prediction.
* **Z-Axis Acceleration**: Explains 1G acceleration in Z-axis when stationary and how tilting affects sensor readings.
* **Practical Application**: Using the sensor for tilt measurement (pitch and roll) in carpentry, off-roading, and aviation.
* **Homework Assignment**: Calculate tilt angles (pitch and roll) using sensor data and apply previous math concepts.
