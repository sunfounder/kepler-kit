lesson 71 :  Allow Thread to Complete Task Before Termination
===================================================================================

This tutorial covers gracefully terminating a multi-threaded program on the Raspberry Pi Pico W:

* **Wiring Setup**: Connect servo control to GPIO 17, power to pin 40, ground to pin 38. Connect button to GPIO 16 and ground.
* **Code Implementation**: Import ``machine``, ``time``, ``_thread``, ``Servo``. Set up pins for button and servo. Implement a toggle switch for servo movement, using threading for clean exits.
* **Handling Clean Termination**: Use a global ``running`` variable to manage loop execution. Implement a lock to control critical sections. Ensure the servo completes movement before terminating.
* **Homework Assignment**: Modify the program to handle more components or sensors, ensuring clean termination in all cases.
