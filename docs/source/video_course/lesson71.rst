lesson 71 :  Allow Thread to Complete Task Before Termination
===================================================================================

This tutorial covers gracefully terminating a multi-threaded program on the Raspberry Pi Pico W:

* **Wiring Setup**:
  - Connect the servo's control wire to GPIO pin 17, power wire to physical pin 40, and ground wire to physical pin 38.
  - Connect a button to GPIO pin 16 and ground.
* **Code Implementation**:
  - Import necessary libraries (`machine`, `time`, `_thread`, `Servo`).
  - Set up pins for the button and servo.
  - Implement a toggle switch for the button to control the servo's movement.
  - Define a main loop to detect button presses and toggle the servo between 0 and 180 degrees.
  - Use threading to handle the servo movement on a separate core, allowing for clean program exits.
* **Handling Clean Termination**:
  - Use a global `running` variable to control the loop execution.
  - Implement a baton (lock) to ensure only one part of the program runs at a time during critical sections.
  - Wait for the servo movement to complete before terminating the program.
* **Homework Assignment**:
  - Modify the program to handle additional components or sensors, ensuring clean termination in all scenarios.
