Lesson 28: Connecting the Raspberry Pi Pico W to WiFi
=============================================================================

This tutorial covers setting up a client-server relationship between a Raspberry Pi Pico W and a PC over Wi-Fi:

* **Introduction**: Goal is to connect the Raspberry Pi Pico W to Wi-Fi and establish a client-server relationship with a PC.
* **Understanding Client-Server Relationship**: Uses a McDonald's analogy to explain the concept, with the PC as the client and the Pico W as the server.
* **Setting Up the Raspberry Pi Pico W as a Server**: Explains how to connect to Wi-Fi, retrieve an IP address, and set up a UDP server.
* **Creating a Client on the PC**: Provides code for the PC client to send commands to the Raspberry Pi Pico W server.
* **Sending and Receiving Data**: Shows how the server decodes client commands and sends responses.
* **Practical Demonstration**: Runs the server and client, showing data exchange with the Pico W displaying its IP on an OLED.
