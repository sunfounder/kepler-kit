lesson 7:  Controlling 3 LED with a Potentiometer in Micropython
====================================================================

This tutorial covers using a potentiometer to control three LEDs (green, yellow, and red) with the Raspberry Pi Pico W:

* **Homework Solution Review**: Recap of connecting a potentiometer and three LEDs, mapping readings from 0 to 100.
* **Circuit Setup**: Wiring diagram for connecting the potentiometer and LEDs to the Raspberry Pi Pico W.
* **Reading and Mapping Values**: Reading analog values and mapping them from 432-65,535 to a 0-100 scale.
* **LED Control**: Using if statements to control LEDs based on the potentiometer's position (green for 0-79, yellow for 80-94, red for 95-100).
* **Practical Demonstration**: Showcasing the circuit and code in action.
