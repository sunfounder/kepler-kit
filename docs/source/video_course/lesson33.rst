lesson 33 : Display the HSV Color Wheel on an RGB LED
=============================================================================

This tutorial covers displaying the HSV (Hue, Saturation, Value) color wheel on an RGB LED using the Raspberry Pi Pico W:

* **Introduction to HSV Color Wheel**:
 - Introduction to the concept of HSV color representation and its importance in visualizing temperature data.
 - Explanation of the HSV color wheel and how different angles represent different colors.
* **Project Setup and Goal**:
 - Recap of the previous lesson where a remote sensorless weather station was built using the Raspberry Pi Pico W and an OLED display.
 - Introduction to the new objective of displaying a visual representation of temperature using an RGB LED.
* **Understanding HSV to RGB Conversion**:
 - Detailed explanation of the HSV color wheel, focusing on angles and corresponding colors.
 - Explanation of the mathematical conversion from HSV to RGB values.
* **Algorithm Development**:
 - Step-by-step breakdown of how to convert HSV angles to RGB values.
 - Explanation of how to map temperature values to specific angles on the HSV color wheel.
 - Practical application of this algorithm to the RGB LED to display temperature data.
* **Homework Assignment**:
 - Task to write a function that converts an angle from the HSV color wheel to RGB values.
 - Encouragement to use the RGB LED to visually represent weather conditions, such as temperature and wind speed.
