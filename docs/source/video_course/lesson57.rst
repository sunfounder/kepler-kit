lesson 57 : Calibrating a Joystick in MicroPython
=============================================================================

This tutorial covers calibrating a joystick with the Raspberry Pi Pico W:

* **Wiring Setup**: Connect ground to pin 38, 3.3V to pin 36, VRX to GPIO pin 27, and VRY to GPIO pin 26.
* **Code Implementation**: Import ``machine``, ``time``, ``math``; set up ADC for joystick axes; read and print joystick values.
* **Calibration**: Convert raw ADC values to a scale of -100 to +100, adjusting for neutral position noise.
* **Homework Assignment**: Write a program to calculate and report the angle of the joystick based on its position.
