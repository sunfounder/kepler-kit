lesson 57 : Calibrating a Joystick in MicroPython
=============================================================================

This tutorial covers calibrating a joystick with the Raspberry Pi Pico W:

* **Wiring Setup**:
   - Connect ground to physical pin 38, 3.3V to pin 36, VRX to GPIO pin 27, and VRY to GPIO pin 26.
* **Code Implementation**:
   - Import necessary libraries (`machine`, `time`, `math`).
   - Set up ADC for joystick axes.
   - Read and print joystick values for initial calibration.
* **Calibration**:
   - Calculate and apply calibration equations to convert raw ADC values to a scale from -100 to +100 for both axes.
   - Adjust for intuitive coordinate system and eliminate noise around the neutral position.
* **Homework Assignment**:
   - Write a program to calculate and report the angle of the joystick based on its position.
