lesson 70 :  Example of Cleanly Exiting Dual Core Program in MicroPython
===================================================================================

This tutorial covers using threading to control a servo and a button with the Raspberry Pi Pico W:

* **Wiring Setup**:

- Connect the servo's control wire to GPIO pin 17, power wire to physical pin 40, and ground wire to physical pin 38.
- Connect a button to GPIO pin 16 and ground.

* **Code Implementation**:

 - Import necessary libraries (`machine`, `time`, `_thread`, `Servo`).
 - Set up pins for the button and servo.
 - Implement a toggle switch for the button to control the servo's movement.
 - Define a main loop to detect button presses and toggle the servo between 0 and 180 degrees.
 - Use threading to handle the servo movement on a separate core, allowing for clean program exits.

* **Homework Assignment**:

 - Modify the program to ensure it exits cleanly even if interrupted while the servo is moving.
