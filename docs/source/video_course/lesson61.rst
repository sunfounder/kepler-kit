lesson 61 : How to Write Modular Code With Micropython Functions
=============================================================================

This tutorial covers using functions in MicroPython on the Raspberry Pi Pico W:

* **Concept Overview**:Introduction to modular programming using functions.
* **Example Implementation**:Calculate the perimeter, area, and diagonal of a rectangle with functions.Define and call functions in MicroPython.Use return values to pass results from functions to the main program.
* **Steps**:1. Define the main function to call sub-functions.2. Create functions to calculate the area, perimeter, and diagonal.3. Call these functions from the main program and display results.
* **Homework Assignment**:Write a program to input grades, find the highest and lowest grades, calculate the average, and sort the grades.Use functions to handle each specific task.
* **Key Takeaways**:Understand modular programming and its benefits.Gain experience in defining and using functions in MicroPython.
