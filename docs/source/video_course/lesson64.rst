lesson 64 :  Object Oriented Programming Example in MicroPython with LEDs
===================================================================================

This tutorial covers object-oriented programming (OOP) with the Raspberry Pi Pico W, focusing on controlling LEDs:


* **Wiring Setup**: Connect red LED to GPIO 15 and green LED to GPIO 14, with 330-ohm resistors to ground.
* **Class and Methods**: 

   1. Define an ``LED`` class.
   2. Use ``__init__`` to set up the pin.
   3. Implement ``blink`` method to control the LED.

* **Code Implementation**: 

   1. Import ``machine`` and ``time``.
   2. Create ``LED`` class with ``__init__`` and ``blink``.
   3. Instantiate red and green LEDs.
