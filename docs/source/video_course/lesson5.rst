Lesson 5:  Reading Analog Voltages Using a Potentiometer
=================================================================

This tutorial covers reading analog voltages using the SunFounder Kepler Kit for Raspberry Pi Pico W:

* **Analog Voltage Reading**: Importance of reading analog voltages for sensor inputs like potentiometers.
* **Wiring Setup**: Explains connecting a potentiometer to Pico W, including ground, 3.3V, and GPIO pin 28.
* **Code**: Write Python code to read and print analog voltage values using GPIO pins.
* **Conversion**: Convert ADC values to voltage (0-3.3V) using a linear equation.
* **Demonstration**: Show code reading potentiometer values and converting them to voltage.
