lesson 68 :  MicroPython Multicore Threading Example with LEDs and Servo
===================================================================================

This tutorial covers controlling a servo and LEDs with the Raspberry Pi Pico W using both cores:

* **Wiring Setup**:
 - Connect a red LED to GPIO pin 15 with a 330-ohm resistor to ground.
 - Connect a green LED to GPIO pin 14 with a 330-ohm resistor to ground.
 - Connect the servo control wire to GPIO pin 17, power wire to physical pin 40, and ground wire to physical pin 38.
* **Code Implementation**:
 - Import necessary libraries (`machine`, `time`, `_thread`, `Servo`).
 - Set up pins for the LEDs and servo.
 - Define a function `other_core` to blink the LEDs based on the servo direction using a global variable.
 - Create a loop to move the servo and set the LED direction.
* **Homework Assignment**:
 - Extend the code to blink the red LED when the servo moves clockwise and the green LED when it moves counterclockwise.
