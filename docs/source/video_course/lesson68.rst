lesson 68 :  MicroPython Multicore Threading Example with LEDs and Servo
===================================================================================

This tutorial covers controlling a servo and LEDs with the Raspberry Pi Pico W using both cores:

* **Wiring Setup**: Connect red LED to GPIO 15, green LED to GPIO 14, servo to GPIO 17, power to pin 40, and ground to pin 38.
* **Code Implementation**: Import ``machine``, ``time``, ``_thread``, and ``Servo``. Set up pins for LEDs and servo. Define ``other_core`` function to blink LEDs based on servo direction.
* **Homework Assignment**: Modify code to blink red LED for clockwise and green LED for counterclockwise servo movement.
