Lesson 51: Ultimate Pitch and Roll Gadget Using the MPU6050
=============================================================================
This tutorial covers creating a precise tilt meter using the MPU6050 sensor and Raspberry Pi Pico W:

* **Setup**: Connect the MPU6050 and OLED 1306 to the Raspberry Pi Pico W.
* **Challenges**: Accelerometer data is noisy, and gyroscope data drifts over time.
* **Solution**: Use a complementary filter to combine accelerometer and gyroscope data, with error correction for steady state errors.
* **Implementation**: Initialize sensors and OLED. Collect and filter data, displaying tilt as both a bubble level and degree readout on the OLED.
* **Demonstration**: Test for stable pitch and roll readings, with portable battery-powered operation.
* **Additional Improvements**: Consider wireless monitoring or creating a 3D-printed case for portability.
