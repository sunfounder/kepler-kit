lesson 36 : Control a Servo With MicroPython
=============================================================================
This tutorial covers controlling a servo motor using the Raspberry Pi Pico W:

* **Servo Motor Control**: 
 - Introduction to using the SG90 servo motor with the Raspberry Pi Pico W.
 - Explanation of servo motor connections: brown (ground), red (power), orange (control).
 - Emphasis on not using the Raspberry Pi Pico W to power larger servos due to potential damage.
* **Wiring Diagram and Setup**:
 - Detailed wiring instructions for connecting the SG90 servo to the Raspberry Pi Pico W.
 - Use of GPIO pin 15 for control, and creating a power rail from pin 1 for 5V supply.
* **PWM Basics**:
 - Explanation of Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) and its role in controlling servo position.
 - Calculation of pulse widths corresponding to different servo angles (0.5ms for 0 degrees, 2.5ms for 180 degrees).
 - Setting PWM frequency to 50Hz to match the servo's requirements.
* **Code Explanation**:
 - Step-by-step coding tutorial to set up PWM on GPIO pin 15.
 - Creating a function to convert desired angles to PWM duty cycle values.
 - Example code to control the servo by entering desired angles.
* **Practical Demonstration**:
 - Running the code to move the servo to specific angles.
 - Ensuring safe servo operation by avoiding manual rotation of the servo horn.
* **Homework Assignment**:
 - Task to integrate a potentiometer with the setup to control the servo position by adjusting the potentiometer.
