lesson 48 : Measuring Rotation Using the Gyros on the MPU6050
=============================================================================

This tutorial covers using the MPU6050 sensor with the Raspberry Pi Pico W to create a stable tilt meter by combining accelerometer and gyroscope data:

* **Setup**:
   - Connect the MPU6050 to the Raspberry Pi Pico W using the provided schematic.
* **Concept**:
   - Measure tilt using both accelerometer and gyroscope data.
   - Address errors from acceleration noise and gyroscope drift.
* **Low-Pass Filter**:
   - Smooth accelerometer data to reduce noise.
* **Gyroscope Integration**:
   - Calculate tilt angles using rotational velocity.
   - Update pitch, roll, and yaw angles continuously.
* **Combining Data**:
   - Fuse accelerometer and gyroscope data to minimize noise and drift.
* **Homework**:
   - Implement and fine-tune the described method for stable tilt measurement.
