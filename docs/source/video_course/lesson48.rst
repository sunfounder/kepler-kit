Lesson 48: Measuring Rotation Using the Gyros on the MPU6050
=============================================================================

This tutorial covers using the MPU6050 sensor with the Raspberry Pi Pico W to create a stable tilt meter by combining accelerometer and gyroscope data:

* **Setup**: Connect the MPU6050 to the Raspberry Pi Pico W.
* **Concept**: Measure tilt using accelerometer and gyroscope data, addressing noise and drift.
* **Low-Pass Filter**: Apply to smooth accelerometer data and reduce noise.
* **Gyroscope Integration**: Use rotational velocity to calculate and update pitch, roll, and yaw.
* **Combining Data**: Fuse accelerometer and gyroscope data to minimize errors.
* **Homework**: Implement and fine-tune the method for stable tilt measurement.
