lesson 44 : Measure Simultaneous 0 G on All Three Axis of MPU6050
=============================================================================
This tutorial covers using the MPU6050 sensor with the Raspberry Pi Pico W to measure pitch, roll, and vertical displacement:

* **Setup**: Connect the MPU6050 to the Raspberry Pi Pico W using the provided schematic.

* **Measuring Zero G**: Determine conditions where all accelerometer axes read zero G simultaneously by dropping the sensor.

* **Homework**: Create a method to determine the height from which the sensor was dropped by calculating the time it was in freefall and using the acceleration of gravity.
