lesson 44 : Measure Simultaneous 0 G on All Three Axis of MPU6050
=============================================================================
This tutorial covers using the MPU6050 sensor with the Raspberry Pi Pico W to measure pitch, roll, and vertical displacement:

* **Setup**:
   - Connect the MPU6050 to the Raspberry Pi Pico W using the provided schematic.

* **Measuring Zero G**:
   - Determine conditions where all accelerometer axes read zero G simultaneously by dropping the sensor.

* **Homework**:
   - Create a method to determine the height from which the sensor was dropped by calculating the time it was in freefall and using the acceleration of gravity.
