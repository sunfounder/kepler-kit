Lesson 58: Determine Angular Position of a Joystick in MicroPython
=============================================================================

This tutorial covers calibrating a joystick with the Raspberry Pi Pico W:

* **Wiring Setup**: Connect ground to pin 38, 3.3V to pin 36, VRX to GPIO pin 27, VRY to GPIO pin 26.
* **Code Implementation**: Import necessary libraries.Set up ADC for joystick axes and read values for calibration.
* **Calibration**: Convert raw ADC values to a scale from -100 to +100. Use trigonometry to calculate the joystick's angle.
* **Homework Assignment**: Write a program to control a servo motor based on the joystick's angle, ensuring accurate tracking between 0 and 180 degrees.
