Lesson 50: Removing Long Term Steady State Error from Sensor Data
=============================================================================
This tutorial covers improving tilt measurement accuracy using the MPU6050 sensor and Raspberry Pi Pico W:

* **Setup**: Connect the MPU6050 to the Raspberry Pi Pico W.
* **Challenges**: Accelerometers are noisy, and gyroscopes drift over time.
* **Solution**: Use a complementary filter to combine accelerometer and gyroscope data, with a low-pass filter and error correction.
* **Results**: Achieve accurate, fast, and low-noise tilt measurements.
* **Homework**: Implement the filter and error correction, and display tilt data on an OLED screen.
