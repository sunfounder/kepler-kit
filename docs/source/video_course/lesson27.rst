lesson 27:  Creating Lissajous Patterns on an OLED Display
=============================================================================

This tutorial covers generating Lissajous patterns on an OLED display using the Raspberry Pi Pico W:

* **Introduction**: Goal is to generate a floating "potato chip" Lissajous pattern on an OLED display using the Raspberry Pi Pico W.
* **Recap and Setup**: Reviews drawing circles and introduces the math for Lissajous patterns using sine and cosine functions.
* **Generating the Pattern**: Provides code to draw a circle, then modifies it to create the Lissajous pattern using trigonometric functions.
* **Enhancing the Pattern**: Adjusts parameters and adds phase shift for a rotating effect.
* **Practical Demonstration**: Shows the Lissajous pattern on the OLED, optimizing speed for smooth animations.
* **Homework Assignment**: Task to create a Lissajous pattern and post results on YouTube, experimenting with parameters.
