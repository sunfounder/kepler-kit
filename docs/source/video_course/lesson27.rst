lesson 27:  Creating Lissajous Patterns on an OLED Display
=============================================================================

This tutorial covers generating Lissajous patterns on an OLED display using the Raspberry Pi Pico W:

* **Introduction**:
 - Highlights the goal: generating the floating "potato chip" Lissajous pattern on an OLED display using the Raspberry Pi Pico W.
* **Recap and Setup**:
 - Reviews the previous lesson on drawing a circle on the OLED display.
 - Explains the math behind creating Lissajous patterns using trigonometric functions.
* **Generating the Pattern**:
 - Provides a step-by-step code example to draw a circle and then modify it to generate the Lissajous pattern.
 - Discusses the importance of converting degrees to radians and using sine and cosine functions for the calculations.
* **Enhancing the Pattern**:
 - Shows how to adjust the parameters to change the appearance of the pattern.
 - Demonstrates adding phase shift to create a rotating effect for the pattern.
* **Practical Demonstration**:
 - Runs the code to show the generation of the Lissajous pattern on the OLED display.
 - Explains how to optimize the display update speed and clear the display for smooth animations.
* **Homework Assignment**:
 - Assigns a task: create a Lissajous pattern on the OLED display and post the solution on YouTube.
 - Encourages viewers to experiment with different parameters and share their results.
