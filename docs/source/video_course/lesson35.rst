lesson 35 : Remote Weather Station with RGB LED Temperature Indicator
=============================================================================
This tutorial covers integrating an RGB LED to display temperature data on a weather station using the Raspberry Pi Pico W:

* **Project Overview**:
 - Build a remote weather station using Raspberry Pi Pico W, an OLED display, and an RGB LED to show temperature visually.
* **HSV to RGB Conversion**:
 - Convert temperature values to colors using the HSV color wheel.
 - Map temperatures from -20Â°F (deep violet) to 120Â°F (red) to corresponding angles on the color wheel.
* **Circuit Setup**:
 - Connect the OLED display and RGB LED to the Raspberry Pi Pico W.
 - Configure GPIO pins and PWM for the RGB LED.
* **Coding**:
 - Fetch temperature data, calculate the hue angle, convert it to RGB values, and apply these to the RGB LED.
 - Integrate the HSV to RGB conversion library into the weather station code.
* **Demonstration**:
 - Display temperature data on the OLED and RGB LED.
 - Save and run the code, making the setup portable with battery power.
* **Conclusion**:
 - Customize the project by adjusting color mappings and temperature ranges.
 - Encouragement to subscribe, comment, and share the tutorial.
