lesson 35 : Remote Weather Station with RGB LED Temperature Indicator
=============================================================================
This tutorial covers integrating an RGB LED to display temperature data on a weather station using the Raspberry Pi Pico W:

* **Project Overview**: Build a remote weather station with Raspberry Pi Pico W, OLED display, and RGB LED to visually represent temperature.
* **HSV to RGB Conversion**: Map temperatures from -20Â°F (violet) to 120Â°F (red) to angles on the HSV color wheel.
* **Circuit Setup**: Connect the OLED display and RGB LED to the Raspberry Pi Pico W, configuring GPIO and PWM.
* **Coding**: Fetch temperature data, calculate hue, convert to RGB, and control the RGB LED using the HSV to RGB conversion library.
* **Demonstration**: Display temperature on the OLED and RGB LED, running the setup on battery power.
* **Conclusion**: Customize the project with different color mappings and temperature ranges, and encourage interaction with the tutorial.
