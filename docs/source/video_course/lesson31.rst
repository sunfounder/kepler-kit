Lesson 31: Sensorless Remote Weather Station Project
=============================================================================

This tutorial covers creating a sensorless weather station using the Raspberry Pi Pico W:

* **Connecting to WiFi**: Import libraries and connect to WiFi using a WLAN object.
* **Fetching Weather Data**: Use OpenWeatherMap API to get real-time weather data, requiring an API key.
* **Parsing JSON Data**: Extract temperature, humidity, pressure, sunrise, and sunset times from the JSON response.
* **Code Explanation**: Use ``urequests.get()`` to fetch data, convert Unix time, and adjust pressure units.
* **Displaying Weather Data**: Print temperature, humidity, pressure, conditions, and wind speed.
* **Homework Assignment**: Add a display and create a portable, battery-powered weather station.
