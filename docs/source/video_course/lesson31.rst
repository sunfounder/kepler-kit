lesson 31: Sensorless Remote Weather Station Project
=============================================================================

This tutorial covers creating a sensorless weather station using the Raspberry Pi Pico W:

* **Connecting to WiFi**:
 - Import necessary libraries.
 - Create a WLAN object and connect to the WiFi network.
* **Fetching Weather Data**:
 - Use the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch real-time weather data.
 - Obtain an API key from OpenWeatherMap by signing up for a free account.
* **Parsing JSON Data**:
 - Extract relevant weather information such as temperature, humidity, barometric pressure, sunrise, and sunset times.
* **Code Explanation**:
 - Use `urequests.get()` to fetch JSON data from the API endpoint.
 - Convert Unix epoch time to local time for sunrise and sunset.
 - Convert barometric pressure from HPA to atmospheres.
* **Displaying Weather Data**:
 - Print weather information like temperature, humidity, barometric pressure, conditions, and wind speed.
* **Homework Assignment**:
 - Enhance the project by adding a display to show the weather information.
 - Create a portable, battery-powered weather station.
