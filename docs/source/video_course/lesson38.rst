lesson 38 : Learn Trigonometry Fundamentals in One Session (EASY)
=============================================================================
This tutorial covers the basics of trigonometry and its applications using the Raspberry Pi Pico W:

* **Introduction to Trigonometry**:
 - Explanation of common issues and misconceptions in learning trigonometry.
 - Focus on simplifying concepts using circles instead of triangles.
* **Understanding Circles**:
 - Explanation of unit circles and how rotating a vector traces a circle.
 - Introduction to radians and degrees, including conversion between the two.
* **Basic Trigonometric Functions**:
 - Explanation of sine, cosine, and tangent functions using circles.
 - Demonstration of calculating sine and cosine for given angles.
* - Introduction to inverse functions (arcsine, arccosine) to find angles from sine and cosine values.
* **Programming Examples**:
 - Using MicroPython to calculate sine and cosine values.
 - Example code for converting degrees to radians and calculating trigonometric functions.
* **Homework Assignment**:
 - Find sine and cosine values for 0Â°, 90Â°, 180Â°, 270Â°, and 360Â° without using a calculator, focusing on understanding the concepts visually.
