lesson 49 : Improving IMU Performance with a Complimentary Filter
=============================================================================
This tutorial covers improving tilt measurement accuracy using the MPU6050 sensor and Raspberry Pi Pico W:

* **Setup**:
   - Connect the MPU6050 to the Raspberry Pi Pico W using the provided schematic.
* **Challenges**:
   - Accelerometers alone are fast and accurate but noisy due to vibration and acceleration.
   - Gyroscopes alone are fast and low noise but suffer from drift over time.
* **Solution**:
   - Combine accelerometer and gyroscope data using a complementary filter to get the best of both sensors.
   - Use a low-pass filter for accelerometer data to reduce noise.
   - Use gyroscope data for short-term accuracy and accelerometer data for long-term stability.
* **Implementation**:
   - Calculate roll and pitch from both the accelerometer and gyroscope.
   - Blend these values using the complementary filter to achieve accurate, fast, and low-noise measurements.
* **Results**:
   - The complementary filter provides accurate and responsive tilt measurements with minimal noise and drift.
* **Homework**:
   - Implement the described method to achieve stable tilt measurement.
   - Explore ways to eliminate any remaining steady-state error in the measurements.
