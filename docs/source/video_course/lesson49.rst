Lesson 49: Improving IMU Performance with a Complimentary Filter
=============================================================================
This tutorial covers improving tilt measurement accuracy using the MPU6050 sensor and Raspberry Pi Pico W:

* **Setup**: Connect the MPU6050 to the Raspberry Pi Pico W.
* **Challenges**: Accelerometers are noisy; gyroscopes suffer from drift.
* **Solution**: Use a complementary filter to combine accelerometer and gyroscope data.
* **Implementation**: Calculate roll and pitch, blend using a complementary filter for accuracy and low noise.
* **Results**: Achieve accurate, responsive tilt measurements with minimal noise and drift.
* **Homework**: Implement and fine-tune the method, exploring ways to eliminate steady-state error.
