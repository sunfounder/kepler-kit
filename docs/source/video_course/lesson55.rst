lesson 55 : Create a Dynamic Rainbow With Neopixels in MicroPython
=============================================================================
This tutorial covers creating a running rainbow pattern on a NeoPixel array using the Raspberry Pi Pico W and MicroPython:

* **Wiring Setup**:
   - Connect 5V, GND, and Data pin to GPIO pin 0 on the Pico W.
* **Concept Explanation**:
   - Create a running rainbow pattern by incrementing HSV color values and applying them to each pixel.
* **Code Implementation**:
   - Use a function to convert HSV to RGB.
   - Use nested loops to cycle through the HSV color wheel and update the NeoPixel array.
* **Demonstration and Testing**:
   - Show the running rainbow pattern on the NeoPixel array.
   - Provide troubleshooting tips.
* **Homework Assignment**:
   - Experiment with the code to create additional patterns.
   - Share results with the community.
