lesson 69 :  Cleanly Exit MicroPython Threads When Program Terminates
===================================================================================

This tutorial covers controlling a servo and LEDs with the Raspberry Pi Pico W using both cores:

* **Wiring Setup**: Connect red LED to GPIO 15, green LED to GPIO 14, and servo to GPIO 17, with power to pin 40 and ground to pin 38.
* **Code Implementation**: Import ``machine``, ``time``, ``_thread``, and ``Servo``. Set up pins for LEDs and servo. Define ``other_core`` to blink LEDs based on servo movement. Create loop to control servo and LEDs.
* **Homework Assignment**: Modify the code to blink red LED for clockwise and green LED for counterclockwise servo movement.
