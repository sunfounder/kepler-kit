lesson 18:  Push Button Control of LEDs in Micropython
=============================================================================

This tutorial covers using push buttons to toggle an LED on and off with the Raspberry Pi Pico W:

* **Introduction**: The lesson starts with a brief introduction and an overview of the lesson, focusing on using push buttons to control LEDs on the Raspberry Pi Pico W.
* **Homework Solution**: Provides a solution to the previous lessonâ€™s homework, which involved creating a toggle switch for an LED using a push button.
* **Circuit Setup**: Demonstrates the wiring of a push button to GPIO pin 14 and an LED to GPIO pin 15 on the Raspberry Pi Pico W. Includes connecting the push button and LED to a common ground.
* **Toggle Switch Logic**: Explains the logic required to toggle the LED state with each press and release of the push button. Introduces the concepts of `button state now`, `button state old`, and `LED state`.
* **Code Explanation**: Initializes the GPIO pins for the LED and push button.Uses a while loop to continuously read the button state.Toggles the LED state based on the button press and release actions.Includes print statements for debugging and verifying the states.
* **Practical Demonstration**: Provides a step-by-step demonstration of running the code, pressing the push button, and observing the changes in the LED state.
* **Homework Assignment**: Assigns a new project to use multiple push buttons to control the colors of an RGB LED. The task is to write a program where pressing the red, green, or blue button changes the color of the RGB LED accordingly.
* **Next Steps**: Announces that future lessons will continue exploring the use of push buttons and LEDs, focusing on integrating these components into more complex projects.
