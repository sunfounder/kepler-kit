lesson 10:  Controlling a Dimmable LED with a Potentiometer
==========================================================================

This tutorial covers controlling LED brightness using PWM (Pulse Width Modulation) on the Raspberry Pi Pico W:

* **LED Brightness Control**: Explains how to control LED brightness using PWM. Discusses digital signals, duty cycles, and how varying duty cycles control LED brightness.
* **Wiring Diagram and Setup**: Provides a detailed wiring diagram for connecting an LED with a 220 Ohm resistor to the Raspberry Pi Pico W. Demonstrates the physical setup on a breadboard.
* **Code Explanation**: Describes the code for setting up PWM on a GPIO pin, taking user input for the desired voltage, and converting it to the corresponding PWM duty cycle. Explains the use of libraries, PWM objects, and frequency settings.
* **Practical Demonstration**: Shows how to measure and visualize the PWM signal using an oscilloscope, illustrating how different duty cycles correspond to different average voltages.
* **Homework Assignment**: Asks users to create a circuit that reads input from a potentiometer to control the brightness of an LED, reinforcing the concepts of PWM and analog output.
