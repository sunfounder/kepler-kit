lesson 66 :  Create Your Own Libraries in Micropython
===================================================================================

This tutorial covers creating and using a Servo library with the Raspberry Pi Pico W:

* **Wiring Setup**:
 - Connect the red wire of the servo to physical pin 40 (3.3V), the brown wire to pin 38 (ground), and the orange control wire to GPIO pin 17.
* **Class and Methods**:
 - Define a `Servo` class to manage servo objects.
 - Initialize the servo with the `__init__` method, setting up the PWM pin.
 - Implement a `pos` method to control the servo's position.
* **Library Creation**:
 - Write the `Servo` class code and save it as a library file (`ServoLib.py`).
 - Create a `lib` directory on the Raspberry Pi Pico W and save the library file in this directory.
* **Code Implementation**:
 - Import necessary libraries (`machine`, `time`, and `ServoLib`).
 - Instantiate a servo object using the `Servo` class from the `ServoLib` library.
 - Control the servo's position by calling the `pos` method with desired angles.
* **Homework Assignment**:
 - Create a similar library for another component, like an LED, to streamline its usage in future projects.
