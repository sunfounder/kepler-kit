Lesson 66:  Create Your Own Libraries in Micropython
===================================================================================

This tutorial covers creating and using a Servo library with the Raspberry Pi Pico W:

* **Task Overview**: Control a servo using a custom ``Servo`` class saved as a library.
* **Key Steps**: Define the ``Servo`` class, initialize the servo with ``__init__``, implement the ``pos`` method, save the class as ``ServoLib.py``, and import it for use in code.
* **Homework Assignment**: Create a library for another component like an LED for easier future usage.
