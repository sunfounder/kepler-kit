lesson 74 :  Create a MicroPython Class for Controlling RGB LED
===================================================================================

This tutorial covers creating a MicroPython library for controlling an RGB LED with the Raspberry Pi Pico W:

* **Concept Overview**: Control RGB LED with a custom RGB_LED class using PWM.
* **Example Implementation**: Connect RGB LED to GPIO pins, define a class to manage color changes via PWM, and prompt user input to adjust LED color.
* **Homework Assignment**: Extend the RGB_LED class to add color patterns or more features. Ensure the main program remains simple and leverages the library.
* **Key Takeaways**: Learn to structure code using custom classes for hardware control and handle user inputs efficiently in MicroPython.
