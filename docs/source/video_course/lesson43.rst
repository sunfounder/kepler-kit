Lesson 43: Measure Pitch and Roll Using a 3 Axis Accelerometer
=============================================================================
This tutorial covers using the MPU6050 sensor with the Raspberry Pi Pico W to measure pitch and roll angles:

* **Setup**: Connect the MPU6050 to the Raspberry Pi Pico W using the provided schematic and code.
* **Trigonometry for Tilt Measurement**: Use trigonometric functions to calculate pitch and roll from accelerometer data.
* **Coding**: Implement and test the calculations in Python to ensure accurate pitch and roll measurements.
* **Homework**: Find an orientation where X, Y, and Z accelerations read 0G simultaneously and share the solution.
