Lesson 8:  Compound Conditionals and If Statements in MicroPython
==========================================================================

This tutorial covers using a potentiometer to control three LEDs with the Raspberry Pi Pico W and addresses a critical logical error:

* **Homework Solution Review**: Recap of identifying a logical flaw in the LED control code.
* **Logical Error Explanation**: Discusses the error where LED states overlapped, stressing the need for mutually exclusive conditions.
* **Real-World Example**: Demonstrates the importance of avoiding logical errors through a UV sterilization scenario.
* **Compound Conditionals**: Introduces using AND/OR operators to create precise, non-overlapping conditions.
* **Circuit Setup and Code**: Detailed wiring and corrected code for LED control.
* **Practical Demonstration**: Shows the corrected code in action with proper LED behavior.
* **Next Steps**: Preview of the next Lesson on simulating analog output.
