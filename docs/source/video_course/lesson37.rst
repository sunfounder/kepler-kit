lesson 37 : Control a Servo With a Potentiometer in MicroPython
=============================================================================
This tutorial covers controlling a servo motor using a potentiometer with the Raspberry Pi Pico W:

* **Servo Motor Control**:
 - Connect the SG90 servo motor to the Raspberry Pi Pico W.
 - Brown wire to ground, red wire to power (5V), orange wire to GPIO pin 15 for control.
* **Wiring Setup**:
 - Connect the potentiometer: power to 3.3V, ground to ground rail, and signal to GPIO pin 26.
* **PWM Basics**:
 - Use Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) to control servo position.
 - Set PWM frequency to 50Hz for the servo.
* **Code Explanation**:
 - Set up PWM on GPIO pin 15.
 - Convert potentiometer readings to servo angles.
 - Example code provided to move the servo based on potentiometer input.
* **Practical Demonstration**:
 - Run the code to control the servo with the potentiometer.
 - Avoid manually rotating the servo horn to prevent damage.
* **Application Ideas**:
 - Control larger servos with an external power supply for more advanced projects.
