lesson 37 : Control a Servo With a Potentiometer in MicroPython
=============================================================================
This tutorial covers controlling a servo motor using a potentiometer with the Raspberry Pi Pico W:

* **Servo Motor Control**: Connect the SG90 servo to the Raspberry Pi Pico W, with ground, power (5V), and control on GPIO pin 15.
* **Wiring Setup**: Connect the potentiometer to 3.3V, ground, and signal to GPIO pin 26.
* **PWM Basics**: Use PWM at 50Hz to control the servo's position.
* **Code Explanation**: Set up PWM on GPIO 15 and convert potentiometer input to servo angles.
* **Practical Demonstration**: Run the code to control the servo with the potentiometer, avoiding manual servo horn rotation.
* **Application Ideas**: Use external power to control larger servos for advanced projects.
