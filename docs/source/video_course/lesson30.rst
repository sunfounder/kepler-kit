Lesson 30: Project to Connect Your Raspberry Pi Pico W to the Internet
=============================================================================

This tutorial covers connecting the Raspberry Pi Pico W to the internet and fetching data from APIs:

* **Fetching Data from APIs**: Use ``urequests.get()`` to fetch JSON data and parse it to extract relevant information.
* **Code Example**: Fetch data about astronauts in space, list their names and spacecraft.
* **Homework**: Find a real-time data set (e.g., weather), fetch and display it using the Raspberry Pi Pico W.
