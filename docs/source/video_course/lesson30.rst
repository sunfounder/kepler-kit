lesson 30: Project to Connect Your Raspberry Pi Pico W to the Internet
=============================================================================

This tutorial covers connecting the Raspberry Pi Pico W to the internet and fetching data from APIs:

**Introduction**:

- The goal is to connect the Raspberry Pi Pico W to the internet and fetch real-time data from APIs.
- No additional hardware setup required.

**Connecting to WiFi**:

- Import necessary libraries: `network`, `time`, `urequests`.
- Create a WLAN object and connect to the WiFi network.
- Ensure successful connection before proceeding.

**Fetching Data from APIs**:

- Introduction to JSON files and their structure (arrays, dictionaries, nested elements).
- Example API used: Fetching real-time data about astronauts in space.
- Parse and print the data structure to understand its format.

**Code Explanation**:

- Use `urequests.get()` to fetch JSON data from a specified API endpoint.
- Parse the JSON data to extract relevant information.
- Example: List names of astronauts currently in space and their respective spacecraft.

**Practical Demonstration**:

- Code snippet to fetch and display data about astronauts.
- Demonstrates how to navigate nested JSON structures to extract specific data.
- Example output: Number of astronauts, their names, and spacecraft.

**Homework Assignment**:

- Find an interesting real-time data set (e.g., weather, stock prices, earthquakes).
- Fetch and parse the data using the Raspberry Pi Pico W.
- Display or utilize the data in a meaningful way (e.g., sensorless weather station).
