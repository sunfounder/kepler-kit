lesson 39 : Practical Trigonometry for Easy Problem Solving
=============================================================================
This tutorial covers practical trigonometry necessary for real-life applications using the Raspberry Pi Pico W:

* **Introduction to Practical Trigonometry**:
 - Recap of previous lesson on trigonometry, focusing on understanding circles and angles.
 - Explanation of using trigonometry to solve problems involving the MPU 6050 sensor for tilt measurement.
* **Key Concepts**:
 - Understanding trigonometric functions (sine, cosine) in relation to circles.
 - Converting between degrees and radians for calculations.
 - Using trigonometric functions to find coordinates (x, y) on a circle based on an angle.
 - Calculating angles from given coordinates using arc functions (arcsine, arccosine).
* **Applying Trigonometry to Real-World Problems**:
 - Explanation of hypotenuse, adjacent, and opposite sides in right triangles.
 - Rewriting trigonometric equations using hypotenuse, adjacent, and opposite sides.
 - Solving vector problems and inclined plane problems using trigonometry.
 - Example problems demonstrating practical applications.
* **Summary and Homework**:
 - Recap of key trigonometric equations and concepts.
 - Homework assignment to practice finding sine and cosine values for specific angles without using a calculator.
 - Emphasis on understanding the concepts to apply them in future projects involving the MPU 6050 sensor.
* **Next Steps**:
 - Preview of upcoming lessons on using the MPU 6050 sensor for tilt measurement projects.
 - Encouragement to review and understand the trigonometry concepts for successful project implementation.
