lesson 6:  Understanding If Statements in MicroPython
=================================================================

This tutorial covers using if statements and conditionals in MicroPython with the Raspberry Pi Pico W:

* **User Input Handling**: Demonstrates how to get input from the user using the input() function and convert it into different data types, such as integers and floating-point numbers.
* **Basic If Statements**: Explains how to use if statements to execute code based on certain conditions, including checking for equality (==), inequality (!=), greater than (>), less than (<), greater than or equal to (>=), and less than or equal to (<=).
* **Conditional Logic**: Illustrates how to implement logic based on user input to control the state of an LED (on, off, toggle) using if, elif, and else statements.
* **Practical Demonstration**: Provides a detailed walkthrough of setting up an LED circuit on a breadboard and controlling the LED based on user input through conditional statements in MicroPython.
* **Homework Assignment**: Assigns a project to build a circuit with a potentiometer and three LEDs (red, yellow, green). The task involves converting potentiometer readings to a 0-100 scale and lighting up the LEDs based on the input range:
Green LED for 0-79
Yellow LED for 80-94
Red LED for 95-100
Encourages posting the project on YouTube and engaging with others to develop a sense of community.
