Lesson 6:  Understanding If Statements in MicroPython
=================================================================

This tutorial covers using if statements and conditionals in MicroPython with the Raspberry Pi Pico W:

* **User Input Handling**: How to get and convert user input into different data types.
* **Basic If Statements**: Use if statements to check conditions like equality, inequality, and comparisons.
* **Conditional Logic**: Control an LED's state (on, off, toggle) using if, elif, and else statements.
* **Practical Demonstration**: Set up an LED circuit and control it based on user input.
* **Homework Assignment**: Build a circuit with a potentiometer and three LEDs, lighting them up based on input ranges.
