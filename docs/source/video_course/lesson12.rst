lesson 12:  Create a Dimmable LED in Micropython
==========================================================================
This tutorial covers controlling LED brightness using a potentiometer and PWM on the Raspberry Pi Pico W:

* **LED Brightness Control**: Explains controlling brightness with PWM and introduces exponential scaling for smoother brightness perception.
* **Wiring Diagram and Setup**: Detailed diagram for connecting a potentiometer and LED with a 220 Ohm resistor to the Pico W.
* **Code Explanation**: Code setup for PWM, reading analog values from the potentiometer, and converting them to PWM duty cycles.
* **Practical Demonstration**: Shows how to visualize PWM signals with an oscilloscope and demonstrates the effect of exponential scaling on brightness transitions.
