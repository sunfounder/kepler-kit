lesson 67 :  Use Both Cores on Your Pi Pico with MicroPython
===================================================================================

This tutorial covers using both cores of the Raspberry Pi Pico W:

* **Wiring Setup**:
- Connect a green LED to GPIO pin 14 with a 330-ohm resistor to ground.
- Connect a red LED to GPIO pin 15 with a 330-ohm resistor to ground.
* **Code Implementation**:
- Import necessary libraries (`machine`, `time`, `_thread`).
- Set up pins for the LEDs.
- Define parameters for LED blink times.
- Create functions to control LED blinking:
   - `other_core` for the red LED on the second core.
   - `green_blink` for the green LED on the main core.
- Use `_thread.start_new_thread` to run `other_core` on the second core.
* **Homework Assignment**:
- Connect a servo.
- Control the servo and LEDs:
  - Blink red LED when servo moves backward.
  - Blink green LED when servo moves forward.
