lesson 67 :  Use Both Cores on Your Pi Pico with MicroPython
===================================================================================

This tutorial covers using both cores of the Raspberry Pi Pico W:

* **Concept Overview**: Control LEDs and a servo using threading and functions.
* **Example Implementation**: Connect red and green LEDs to GPIO pins, set up threading to blink LEDs on separate cores, and control a servo based on direction.
* **Homework Assignment**: Add servo control, blink the red LED when the servo moves backward, and blink the green LED when it moves forward.
* **Key Takeaways**: Learn to use threading to control LEDs and servos simultaneously on separate cores.
