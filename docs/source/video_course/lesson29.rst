Lesson 29: Simple Client Server Project to Control RGB LED
=============================================================================

This tutorial covers setting up a remote-controlled RGB LED using a Raspberry Pi Pico W and a PC over Wi-Fi:

* **Introduction**: Goal is to control an RGB LED on a Raspberry Pi Pico W remotely using Wi-Fi.
* **Wiring Diagram and Setup**: Connect RGB LED to GPIO pins 16, 17, 18, and OLED to GPIO pins 2 (SDA) and 3 (SCL).
* **Server Side Setup**: Import libraries, initialize GPIO pins, connect to Wi-Fi, create a UDP server, and display the IP on the OLED.
* **Client Side Setup**: Create a UDP client on the PC to send color commands to the server.
* **Practical Demonstration**: Show changing RGB LED color via commands sent from the PC, with the OLED displaying the commands and IP.
* **Final Setup and Testing**: Power the Raspberry Pi Pico W with a battery, save the code as ``main.py``, and demonstrate wireless operation.
