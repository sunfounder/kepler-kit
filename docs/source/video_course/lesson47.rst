lesson 47 : Improving Sensor Data With a Low Pass Filter
=============================================================================
This tutorial covers using the MPU6050 sensor with the Raspberry Pi Pico W to create a stable two-axis tilt meter by implementing a low-pass filter:

* **Setup**: Connect the MPU6050 to the Raspberry Pi Pico W.
* **Concept**: Measure tilt using accelerometer data, addressing errors from acceleration.
* **Low-Pass Filter**: Implement to smooth data using the equation: ``\(\text{new value} = \text{confidence} \times \text{measurement} + (1 - \text{confidence}) \times \text{old value}\)``.
* **Code**: Measure X, Y, Z, filter pitch and roll angles, and display results.
* **Homework**: Test the low-pass filter and experiment with confidence values.
