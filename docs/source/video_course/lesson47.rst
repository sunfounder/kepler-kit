lesson 47 : Improving Sensor Data With a Low Pass Filter
=============================================================================
This tutorial covers using the MPU6050 sensor with the Raspberry Pi Pico W to create a stable two-axis tilt meter by implementing a low-pass filter:

* **Setup**:
   - Connect the MPU6050 to the Raspberry Pi Pico W using the provided schematic.

* **Concept**:
   - Measure tilt using the MPU6050's accelerometer data to calculate pitch and roll angles.
   - Address errors caused by interpreting acceleration as tilt.

* **Low-Pass Filter**:
   - Implement a low-pass filter to smooth out data and reduce noise.
   - Equation: \(\text{new value} = \text{sensor confidence} \times \text{measurement} + (1 - \text{sensor confidence}) \times \text{old value}\)
   - Adjust the confidence value for the best balance between responsiveness and noise reduction.

* **Code**:
   - Set up the MPU6050 to measure X, Y, and Z acceleration.
   - Calculate and filter pitch and roll angles.
   - Display the filtered values.

* **Homework**:
   - Implement and test the low-pass filter.
   - Experiment with different confidence values.
