lesson 17:  Buttons and Pull Up Resistors in Micropython
=============================================================================

This tutorial covers using push buttons in MicroPython with the Raspberry Pi Pico W:

* **Introduction**: The lesson starts with a brief introduction and an overview of the lesson, focusing on using push buttons to control components like LEDs on the Raspberry Pi Pico W.
* **Types of Push Buttons**: Describes different types of push buttons available in the SunFounder kit, explaining their functionality and how they connect within a circuit.
* **Circuit Setup**: Demonstrates the wiring of a push button to GPIO pin 14 on the Raspberry Pi Pico W, including the use of internal pull-up resistors to simplify the circuit. Provides a detailed schematic and visual setup.
* **How Push Buttons Work**: Explains the concept of open and closed states of push buttons and how they are used to control circuits by making or breaking connections.
* **Activating Internal Pull-Up Resistors**: Shows how to activate the internal pull-up resistors on the Raspberry Pi Pico W using MicroPython, eliminating the need for external resistors.
* **Code Explanation**: Describes the MicroPython code for reading the state of a push button. Covers setting up the GPIO pin, reading the button state, and printing the button state to the console.
* **Practical Demonstration**: Provides a step-by-step demonstration of running the code, pressing the push button, and observing the changes in the button state readings on the console.
* **Homework Assignment**: Assigns a project to use a push button to control an LED. The task is to write a program where pressing the button turns the LED on, and pressing it again turns the LED off.
* **Next Steps**: Announces that the next lesson will continue exploring the use of push buttons and LEDs, focusing on integrating these components into more complex projects.
