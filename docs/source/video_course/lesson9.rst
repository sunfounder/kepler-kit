lesson 9:  Getting Analog Output Using PWM (Pulse Width Modulation)
==========================================================================

This tutorial covers generating analog output using PWM on the Raspberry Pi Pico W:

* **Analog Output Explanation**: Explains PWM and how it simulates analog output by adjusting duty cycles.
* **GPIO Pin Configuration**: Describes which GPIO pins can generate PWM and the importance of not using overlapping PWM labels.
* **Circuit Setup and Code**: Provides a wiring diagram and code to set up PWM, take voltage input, and convert it to a PWM duty cycle.
* **Practical Demonstration**: Shows how to measure PWM signals with an oscilloscope to visualize different duty cycles.
* **Homework Assignment**: Create a circuit to control LED brightness using user-input voltage and PWM.
