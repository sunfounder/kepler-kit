lesson 13:  User Specified RGB LED Colors Using Micropython
==========================================================================

This tutorial covers controlling an RGB LED using the SunFounder Kepler Kit and Raspberry Pi Pico W:

* **RGB LED Control**: Demonstrates controlling an RGB LED with PWM to achieve different colors using red, green, blue, and ground legs.
* **Wiring Diagram and Setup**: Detailed wiring diagram for connecting RGB LED to GPIO pins 13, 14, and 15, each with a 220 Ohm resistor.
* **Code Explanation**: MicroPython code for setting up PWM on each color channel, allowing color control based on user input.
* **Practical Demonstration**: Shows how to input a color and change the RGB LED color accordingly.
* **Homework Assignment**: Extend the project by using three potentiometers to manually control the RGB LED colors.
