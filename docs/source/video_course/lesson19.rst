lesson 19:  Button Control of RGB LED in Micropython
=============================================================================

This tutorial covers using multiple push buttons to control the RGB channels of an LED on the Raspberry Pi Pico W:

* **Introduction**: The lesson starts with an overview of the lesson, focusing on using three push buttons to control the red, green, and blue channels of an RGB LED on the Raspberry Pi Pico W.
* **Homework Solution**: Provides a solution to the previous lessonâ€™s homework, which involved creating three toggle switches for an RGB LED using push buttons.
* **Circuit Setup**: Demonstrates the wiring of three push buttons and an RGB LED to the Raspberry Pi Pico W. Each button is connected to a GPIO pin, and the RGB LED channels are connected through resistors to separate GPIO pins. The ground rail is established to complete the circuit.
* **Code Explanation**: 
 - Initializes the GPIO pins for the RGB LED and push buttons.
 - Creates objects for each LED channel and button, setting them as inputs or outputs as needed.
 - Defines variables for button states and LED states.
 - Implements logic to toggle the LED channels based on button presses and releases.
 - Demonstrates how to write and organize the code methodically, ensuring consistent variable naming for readability and ease of debugging.
* **Practical Demonstration**: 
 - Provides a step-by-step demonstration of running the code, pressing the push buttons, and observing the changes in the RGB LED channels.
 - Shows how to test the button functionality and verify that each button correctly toggles its respective LED channel.
 - Discusses debugging techniques to identify and fix errors in the code or circuit.
