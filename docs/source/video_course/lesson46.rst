Lesson 46: Build a 2 Axis Tilt Meter with Display Using the MPU6050
=============================================================================
This tutorial covers using the MPU6050 sensor with the Raspberry Pi Pico W to create a two-axis tilt meter:

* **Setup**: Connect MPU6050 and OLED 1306 to Raspberry Pi Pico W.
* **Concept**: Measure tilt using pitch and roll angles, display bubble level on OLED.
* **Equation**: 
   - Pitch: \(\arctan\left(\frac{Y}{Z}\right)\)
   - Roll: \(\arctan\left(\frac{X}{Z}\right)\)
   - Convert radians to degrees.
* **Code**: Set up libraries, measure X, Y, Z acceleration, calculate angles, and display on OLED.
* **Demonstration**: Test tilt, adjust bubble movement for responsiveness.
* **Advanced**: Stabilize tilt readings to avoid errors from acceleration or vibrations.
