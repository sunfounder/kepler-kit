lesson 46 : Build a 2 Axis Tilt Meter with Display Using the MPU6050
=============================================================================
This tutorial covers using the MPU6050 sensor with the Raspberry Pi Pico W to create a two-axis tilt meter:

* **Setup**:
   - Connect the MPU6050 and OLED 1306 to the Raspberry Pi Pico W using the provided schematic. Ensure all connections are secure to avoid electrical noise.
* **Concept**:
   - Measure the tilt of the sensor using the MPU6050's accelerometer data to calculate pitch and roll angles. Use these angles to create a visual representation of a bubble level on the OLED display.
* **Equation**:
   - Calculate pitch and roll angles using the following formulas:
     - Pitch: \(\text{Pitch} = \arctan\left(\frac{\text{Y acceleration}}{\text{Z acceleration}}\right)\)
     - Roll: \(\text{Roll} = \arctan\left(\frac{\text{X acceleration}}{\text{Z acceleration}}\right)\)
   - Convert these angles from radians to degrees.
* **Code Implementation**:
   - Set up the MPU6050 and OLED 1306 libraries.
   - Measure the X, Y, and Z acceleration values.
   - Calculate pitch and roll angles in degrees.
   - Display the calculated pitch and roll angles on the OLED along with a visual representation of a bubble moving within a rectangle to indicate tilt.
* **Practical Demonstration**:
   - Test the setup by tilting the sensor and observing the bubble's movement on the OLED display. Adjust the sensitivity of the bubble's movement to make the tilt meter more responsive.
   - Ensure the readings are accurate and the bubble moves smoothly according to the tilt angles.
* **Advanced Considerations**:
   - Address the challenge of the accelerometer interpreting acceleration and deceleration as tilt. Think about strategies to stabilize the readings and prevent incorrect tilt detection due to vibrations or movements.
