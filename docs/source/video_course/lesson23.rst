lesson 23:  Temperature and Humidity Sensor with LCD Display
=============================================================================

This tutorial covers creating a temperature and humidity project using the Raspberry Pi Pico W and DHT-11 sensor with an LCD display:

* **Introduction**: introduces the tutorial, acknowledges the sponsor SunFounder, and reviews the goal of the lesson, which is to create a temperature and humidity sensor project with an LCD display.
* **Component Introduction and Setup**:
 - Describes the required components: Raspberry Pi Pico W, DHT-11 sensor, push button, and LCD 1602 display.
 - Provides a schematic and instructions for connecting these components, referring to previous lessons for detailed wiring instructions.
* **Library Installation**:
 - Guides on how to download and install the necessary library for the LCD 1602 display from toptechboy.com.
 - Provides instructions to save and import the library in Thonny IDE.
* **Code Explanation**:
 - Describes setting up the DHT-11 sensor and push button using GPIO pins.
 - Introduces a flag variable for toggling between Celsius and Fahrenheit.
 - Explains the code for reading temperature and humidity from the DHT-11 sensor.
 - Details the implementation of a toggle function to switch between Celsius and Fahrenheit.
 - Explains how to display the readings on both the console and the LCD.
* **Practical Demonstration**:
 - Shows the program in action, displaying temperature and humidity readings on the LCD.
 - Demonstrates the toggle functionality to switch between Celsius and Fahrenheit.
 - Addresses potential issues with text overlap on the LCD by adding spaces and using `LCD.clear()` to clear the screen before writing new text.
