Lesson 45: Calculating Height from a Dropped Object in Freefall
=============================================================================
This tutorial covers using the MPU6050 sensor with the Raspberry Pi Pico W to measure vertical distances:

* **Setup**: Connect the MPU6050 and OLED 1306 to the Raspberry Pi Pico W, ensuring secure connections to reduce noise.
* **Concept**: Measure vertical distance by calculating the time (T_drop) in freefall and use it to determine the height dropped.
* **Equation**: Calculate height (H) with \( H = 16 \times (T_{drop})^2 \), converting time from milliseconds to seconds.
* **Code Implementation**: Set up libraries, measure Z-axis acceleration to detect 0G, start a timer during freefall, and display height and drop time on the OLED.
* **Practical Demonstration**: Test by dropping the sensor from known heights and adjust for accuracy as needed.
