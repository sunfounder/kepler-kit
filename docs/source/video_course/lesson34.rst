lesson 34 : Convert HSV to RGB in Micropython
=============================================================================
This tutorial covers converting HSV (Hue, Saturation, Value) color values to RGB (Red, Green, Blue) values and displaying them on an RGB LED using the Raspberry Pi Pico W:

* **Introduction to the HSV Color Wheel**: Explains the HSV color wheel and its use for smooth color transitions, especially for visualizing temperature data.
* **Project Setup and Goal**: Recap of the weather station project and the goal of adding RGB LED color representation for temperature.
* **Understanding HSV to RGB Conversion**: Describes the HSV color wheel's mathematical representation, zones, and RGB conversion.
* **Algorithm Development**: Creates a function to convert HSV to RGB values and sets up the RGB LED with PWM on the Raspberry Pi Pico W.
* **Code Implementation**: Walkthrough of Python code for PWM control and HSV to RGB conversion, including a library function.
* **Practical Demonstration**: Shows RGB LED color changes based on HSV, and assigns the task of integrating the LED into the weather station project.
