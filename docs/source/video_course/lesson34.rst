lesson 34 : Convert HSV to RGB in Micropython
=============================================================================
This tutorial covers converting HSV (Hue, Saturation, Value) color values to RGB (Red, Green, Blue) values and displaying them on an RGB LED using the Raspberry Pi Pico W:

* **Introduction to the HSV Color Wheel**:
 - Explanation of the HSV color wheel and its significance in representing smooth color transitions.
 - Overview of how the HSV color wheel can be used to visually represent temperature data.
* **Project Setup and Goal**:
 - Recap of the weather station project that fetches weather data and displays it on an OLED screen.
 - Introduction to the goal of adding a visual representation of temperature using an RGB LED.
* **Understanding HSV to RGB Conversion**:
 - Breakdown of the HSV color wheel into a mathematical representation for conversion.
 - Explanation of the six zones in the color wheel and the respective RGB values and slopes.
* **Algorithm Development**:
 - Step-by-step creation of a function to convert HSV angles to RGB values.
 - Explanation of setting up the RGB LED circuit with PWM control on the Raspberry Pi Pico W.
* **Code Implementation**:
 - Detailed walkthrough of the Python code to set up PWM for the RGB LED and perform the HSV to RGB conversion.
 - Creation of a library function for the conversion to simplify the main program.
* **Practical Demonstration**:
 - Demonstration of the code in action, showing the RGB LED changing colors according to the HSV color wheel.
 - Assignment to integrate the RGB LED with the weather station project to display temperature data visually.
