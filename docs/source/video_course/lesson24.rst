lesson 24:  Power Portable Projects with LiPo Rechargeable Battery
=============================================================================

This tutorial covers powering a Raspberry Pi Pico W project with a rechargeable LiPo battery, making the project portable:

* **Introduction**: introduces the tutorial, acknowledging the sponsor SunFounder, and reviews the goal of the lesson: making the DHT-11 temperature and humidity sensor project portable.
* **Component Review and Setup**:
 - Recaps the previous project setup: Raspberry Pi Pico W, DHT-11 sensor, push button, and LCD 1602 display.
 - Discusses the need to remove the USB cable and power the project using a LiPo battery.
* **Library Installation**:
 - Guides viewers on how to install the LCD 1602 library if they haven't already.
* **Code Explanation**:
 - Describes the necessity of saving the program as `main.py` so it runs automatically when the Pico W is powered.
 - Demonstrates saving the code and verifying its functionality.
* **Powering the Project with a Battery**:
 - Introduces the rechargeable LiPo battery and the battery holder from the SunFounder Kepler kit.
 - Details connecting the battery to the Pico W using a power management module included in the kit.
 - Explains adjusting the LCD power connection from 5V (pin 40) to 3.7V (pin 39) due to the battery output.
 - Shows the setup and verifies the project runs correctly on battery power.
* **Adjustments and Demonstration**:
 - Demonstrates adjusting the LCD contrast for optimal display when powered by the battery.
 - Shows the project working correctly, including toggling between Fahrenheit and Celsius.
* **Conclusion and Next Steps**:
 - Encourages viewers to ensure their project is working and introduces the idea of using an OLED display for future lessons.
 - Recommends purchasing an OLED display for a more compact and energy-efficient setup.
 - Teases future lessons focused on creating portable, deployable projects with enhanced functionality.
* **Homework and Final Notes**:
 - Suggests viewers order the OLED display to prepare for upcoming lessons.
 - Concludes with reminders to like, comment, subscribe, and share the video.
