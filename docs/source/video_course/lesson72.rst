lesson 72 :  Understanding Using Dictionaries in MicroPython
===================================================================================

This tutorial covers using dictionaries in Python with the Raspberry Pi Pico W:

* **Introduction**:
  - Learn about dictionaries, a powerful data structure in Python.
  - Understand how dictionaries fit into object-oriented programming with classes, methods, and functions.
* **Concepts Covered**:
  - Review of Lists:
   - Create and manipulate lists (arrays).Access elements using indices.
  - Introduction to Dictionaries:
   - Create dictionaries with key-value pairs.Access dictionary elements using keys.Add, remove, and modify dictionary elements.
  - Dictionary Operations:
   - Use `keys()` and `values()` methods to retrieve keys and values.Check if a key exists using `in` and `not in` operators.Iterate through keys and values in a dictionary.
  - Practical Example:
   - Create a dictionary to store personal information (name, age, weight, etc.).- Demonstrate adding, modifying, and accessing elements in the dictionary.
  - Advanced Dictionary Use:
   - Store lists and other dictionaries as values within a dictionary.Utilize dictionaries for efficient data management and retrieval.

* **Homework Assignment**:
   - Write a program to control an RGB LED using a dictionary to map color names to their respective RGB values.Implement a user interface to input color names and change the LED color accordingly.
