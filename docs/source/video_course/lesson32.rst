lesson 32: Mobile Weather Station Project
=============================================================================

This tutorial covers creating a portable weather station using the Raspberry Pi Pico W:

* **Connecting to WiFi**:
 - Import necessary libraries.
 - Create a WLAN object and connect to the WiFi network.
* **Fetching Weather Data**:
 - Use the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch real-time weather data.
 - Obtain an API key from OpenWeatherMap by signing up for a free account.
* **Parsing JSON Data**:
 - Extract relevant weather information such as temperature, humidity, barometric pressure, sunrise, and sunset times.
* **Displaying Data on OLED**:
 - Set up an OLED display and connect it to the Raspberry Pi Pico W.
 - Use the `ssd1306` library to display weather data on the OLED screen.
 - Create a loop to periodically update the weather data on the screen.
* **Powering the Device**:
 - Connect the Raspberry Pi Pico W to a battery for portable use.
* **Code Explanation**:
 - Step through initializing the OLED display and connecting to WiFi.
 - Fetch and parse weather data, then display it on the OLED screen.
 - Implement a loop to update the weather data every few minutes.
* **Homework Assignment**:
 - Enhance the project by adding an RGB LED to visually indicate weather conditions such as temperature, humidity, or wind speed.
