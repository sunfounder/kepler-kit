Lesson 32: Mobile Weather Station Project
=============================================================================

This tutorial covers creating a portable weather station using the Raspberry Pi Pico W:

* **Connecting to WiFi**: Import libraries, create a WLAN object, and connect to WiFi.
* **Fetching Weather Data**: Use OpenWeatherMap API to retrieve real-time weather data, requiring an API key.
* **Parsing JSON Data**: Extract temperature, humidity, pressure, sunrise, and sunset times from the JSON response.
* **Displaying Data on OLED**: Set up and connect an OLED display, use the ``ssd1306`` library, and update weather data on the screen in a loop.
* **Powering the Device**: Power the Raspberry Pi Pico W with a battery for portability.
* **Code Explanation**: Initialize the OLED, connect to WiFi, fetch and display weather data, and set a loop for periodic updates.
* **Homework Assignment**: Add an RGB LED to indicate weather conditions based on temperature, humidity, or wind speed.
