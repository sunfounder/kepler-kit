Lesson 42: Measuring Tilt With an MPU6050 Accelerometer
=============================================================================
This tutorial covers using the MPU6050 sensor with the Raspberry Pi Pico W to measure and calculate tilt angles:

* **Introduction**: Measuring acceleration in X, Y, and Z axes with MPU6050, and setting up hardware and software.
* **Previous Lesson Recap**: Recap of measuring accelerations and homework on tilt calculation.
* **Z-Axis Acceleration**: Explains 1G acceleration in the Z-axis due to gravity and tilt effects on readings.
* **Calculating Tilt Angles**: Uses trigonometry to derive tilt equations (pitch and roll) and implements in Python.
* **Practical Application**: Tests code for tilt accuracy and homework to refine pitch and roll measurements.
* **Conclusion**: Emphasizes understanding concepts over using libraries, and encourages support via Patreon.
