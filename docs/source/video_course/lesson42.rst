lesson 42 : Measuring Tilt With an MPU6050 Accelerometer
=============================================================================
This tutorial covers using the MPU6050 sensor with the Raspberry Pi Pico W to measure and calculate tilt angles:

* **Introduction**:
   - Measuring acceleration in X, Y, and Z axes with the MPU6050.
   - Setting up the hardware and software.
* **Previous Lesson Recap**:
   - Measuring X, Y, Z axes acceleration.
   - Homework to calculate tilt based on accelerometer data.
* **Z-Axis Acceleration**:
   - 1G acceleration in the Z-axis due to gravity when stationary.
   - Tilt affects X, Y, and Z readings.
* **Calculating Tilt Angles**:
   - Using trigonometry to derive equations for tilt angles (pitch and roll).
   - Implementing equations in Python to measure tilt.
* **Practical Application**:
   - Testing code for accurate tilt measurement.
   - Homework to modify code for positive and negative pitch and roll.
* **Conclusion**:
   - Encouragement to understand principles rather than relying on libraries.
   - Support through Patreon and sharing the video.
