lesson 14:  Understanding Variable Types and Arrays in Micropython
==========================================================================

This tutorial covers how MicroPython handles variables and arrays using the Raspberry Pi Pico W:

* **Variables in MicroPython**: Explains the dynamic typing in MicroPython, showing how variables can be integers, floats, strings, or Booleans without explicit declarations. Discusses common pitfalls like unintended type conversions and how to avoid them.
* **Basic Operations**: Demonstrates basic arithmetic operations with variables and highlights how division always results in a float, even when dividing integers.
* **String Operations**: Explains how strings are handled in MicroPython, including concatenation using the plus sign and type errors that can occur when mixing strings with other data types.
* **Boolean Operations**: Introduces Boolean variables and logical operations like AND, OR, and NOT. Shows how true and false are represented and used in MicroPython.
* **Arrays (Lists) in MicroPython**: Shows how to create and manipulate one-dimensional arrays (lists) and access individual elements using indexing. Explains how to modify elements and append new elements to the list.
* **Two-Dimensional Arrays**: Demonstrates the creation and use of two-dimensional arrays (lists of lists), including how to access and modify individual elements within the nested lists.
* **Advanced Array Manipulations**: Covers how to concatenate arrays, create arrays with mixed data types, and handle unexpected behaviors that arise from such operations.
* **Practical Examples**: Provides practical examples throughout the tutorial, showing real-time execution of code snippets to illustrate how variables and arrays work in MicroPython.
* **Homework Assignment**: Encourages viewers to practice these concepts by creating and manipulating arrays and experimenting with different data types and operations.
