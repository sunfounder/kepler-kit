lesson 14:  Understanding Variable Types and Arrays in Micropython
==========================================================================

This tutorial covers how MicroPython handles variables and arrays using the Raspberry Pi Pico W:

* **Variables in MicroPython**: Explains dynamic typing, variable types, and common pitfalls like unintended type conversions.
* **Basic Operations**: Demonstrates arithmetic operations, highlighting how division results in a float.
* **String Operations**: Explains string concatenation and type errors when mixing strings with other types.
* **Boolean Operations**: Introduces Boolean variables and logical operations (AND, OR, NOT).
* **Arrays (Lists)**: Shows how to create and manipulate one-dimensional and two-dimensional arrays, access elements, and modify lists.
* **Advanced Array Manipulations**: Covers array concatenation and handling mixed data types.
* **Practical Examples**: Real-time examples illustrating variables and arrays.
* **Homework Assignment**: Practice creating and manipulating arrays and experimenting with data types.
